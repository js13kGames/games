I need your help - my computer seems to be broken.
When I try to do anything I'm getting the FileNotFound error and everything glitches.
Your task is to find the file that doesn't exist.
Glitch effect intensifies when you are getting closer.
Shorter directories names seems to be more corrupted ;)
Look around for easter eggs.
