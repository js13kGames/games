Dodge the oncoming enemies (using the arrow keys on the keyboard, or by tapping the left / right half of the game to turn).

Every second level, you'll be spun around by 2 steps of the shape you're on, and the controls will reverse if you are hit by the special enemy block.

SEIZURE WARNING! Reverse mode may trigger seizures!
