Hi there hero! (⛄)

Talk to people (🙍) and they'll tell you
how many aliens (👽) they've seen.

Don't talk to anyone you suspect is an alien,
or they will WOUND you. (🩸).
**Three wounds and you lose.**

Kill anyone you suspect is an alien.
Don't kill regular people (⚰️)
... or their friends will get mad. (😠)

*(Angry people don't talk!!!)*

**If you you kill 3 regular people, you lose.**

Navigate with WASD, your arrow keys,
or the *on-screen Arrow buttons*.

Use the Talk and Kill buttons or `T` and `K`
on your keyboard.
