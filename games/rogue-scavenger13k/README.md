Rogue Scavenger is a JS game based on graphic assets and game design from Unity's "2D Roguelike tutorial" https://unity3d.com/es/learn/tutorials/projects/2d-roguelike-tutorial
The Unity's version has a 30Mb size. I wanted to pack it in 13K. Anyway, those 14 video Unity tutorials are great ;)

Moreover, I tried to use no HTML5 Canvas or WebGL magic. You'll see a lot of "div" containers being printed and moved on screen: classic DHTML, man :)

Use cursor keys. Search for food. You can destroy walls. Avoid zombies. Survive.
