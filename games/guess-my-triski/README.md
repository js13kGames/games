Guess My Triski, "Triski" inspired by this year's game jam's theme, is an engaging and challenging guessing game where players must solve puzzles by uncovering hidden numbers on a game board.  The ultimate goal is to find the elusive Number 13 among a series of randomly generated numbers.  Each level presents a grid of circles, each hiding a unique number.  Players click on these circles to reveal the numbers, hoping to uncover the Number 13 before running out of guesses or, in competitive mode, before the AI does.

The game features multiple modes: 

- **Fun Mode**: Play at your own pace with no time or guess limits.
- **Challenge Mode**: Race against the clock and a limited number of guesses to find the Number 13.
- **Competitive Mode**: Test your skills against an AI opponent, with both the player and the AI taking turns to guess the hidden numbers.

This is a point-and-click game, however, when in "Competitive" mode, this becomes a turn-based game.

**NOTE FROM THE DEVELOPER**: PLEASE Refresh your browser after playing in "Challenge" mode.  There is an annoying bug that seems to creep up and I'm yet to fix it.
