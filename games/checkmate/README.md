checkmate is an HTML5 puzzle/strategy game that can be played by one or two person, on a desktop or a mobile device that has a browser app in it. 

When the game starts, map will build black and white stones, as well as obstacle/transform blocks on the board. Using arrow keys user can move the white stones correspondingly, while in the same time the black stones are moving in the opposite direction.

When a black stone hit white stone, the two stones will break and gone. One can transform one kind of stone to another by moving it through a transform block. There are two transform blocks in the board, one will transform black to white, the other will transform white to black.

The game finishes either when the white stones are all gone, in which case the black stones win, or vice versa. Note that if the game is played by two persons, they should move alternatively.
