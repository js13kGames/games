In Poland, we say that cats walk their own paths.

Inspired by this, *Lucky Charm* is a high-energy, micro-roguelike auto-battler with no direct combat input. Your only task is to guide your fighter's evolution by choosing powerful upgrades between battles.

# How to play

* Select one of three upgrades before a battle and... that's it. Your fighter will move and attack automatically.
* Discover over 100 upgrades of varying rarity, power, and tier. Equip devastating weapons like the Minigun and the Chiquita Bomb, recruit quirky cat companions, and stack abilities to improve your damage, speed, healing, and Mana generation.
* Mana affects every other statistic, so pay attention to it! The more you have, to more powerful you areâ€”you'll even grow larger on screen, hitting harder but making yourself an easier target.
* Win 33 duels to achieve grand victory and win the game.

# Why 33 duels?

If the entire world's population competed in a one-on-one tournament, the winner would only have to win 33 times to be the last one standing. I can't stop thinking about it.
