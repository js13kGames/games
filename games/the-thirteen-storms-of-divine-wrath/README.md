You are a part of a tribe that has a horrible storm come annually over the course of 13 days. As a coming of age ritual every year young members are sent out to brave the storm each day and return to the village to sleep, going further away each night. 

Your future success as an adult relies on coming back in a timely manner and getting a good night's rest.

Are you up to the task, or will you be kept up all night?
