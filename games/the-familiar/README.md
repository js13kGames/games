You are the familiar of a young witch, but an apocalypse happened while you were at training

Portals have appeared and mosters kidnapped everyone, the village is empty

The old wizzard will guide and assist you to find your master

Explore the portals in search for your master and fight monsters to gain experience

The game wasn't fit in 13kb as a whole for now the dungeon scene is under construction

The combat practice is available and the main village exploration 

I will maybe continue development and publish it on my website and perhaps itch.io later encouraged

only mouse/touch is needed for controlls and music is available from menu disabled by default
