WASD to move around.
Shoot with space.
The worms will leave an area with poison that will hurt you. The goal is to survive and don't run out of space.

When you shoot you will loose the bullet but you can pick it up again if it's inside the level.   After a while you will get a bullet collector that will help you with this task.
