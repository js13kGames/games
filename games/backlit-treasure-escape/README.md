Backlit - The moon is lined up perfectly to solve the puzzles and bring back an ancient treasure, the Golden Scarab!
Controls:
* To rotate a puzzle piece, aim with the laser and hold the trigger. Then, move the controller as if you are holding the piece (ignore the laser).
* To teleport, aim at the floor and press the 'up' area of the trackpad, then release (you must take your finger off the trackpad to teleport)
