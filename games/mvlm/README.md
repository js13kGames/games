Tips
1. You can teleport next to the goal and move into it as well.
2. You can teleport on top of 404 nodes to use the links around.
3. Each level has at least one solution that teleports you to the goal in _difficulty_ moves.
4. If there is only one such possible path, it is guaranteed not to have 404 nodes.
5. If there are multiple such paths, but all of them share certain nodes, those nodess cannot be 404 nodes.
