Blanks Detective is a mystery themed, point-and-click, logic puzzle game with randomly generated puzzles! Fill in the empty spaces on the board as new clues are revealed. If you solve correctly on the first try before the 'possible thumbs up' message, you get a 'gold medal'.  Watch out, your evidence may get stolen along the way.

Periodically you will see the 'case files' screen with features described below.

NEAR (Decentralized) and Coil (Web Monetization) Features:

If you are signed in with NEAR, you can post a new case to the community boards for others to play.

If you are signed in with Coil you can access 'Case Files' from the title screen - selecting 'new case' in this menu skips the tutorial and the 'ramping up' boards. You can also generate a 5x5 board, which is larger than all random boards.


I hope you enjoy!
Thank you for playing!
