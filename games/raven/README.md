In this 2D top-down action-puzzle game, the security cameras for a secret facility have been taken offline, and it is YOUR job to fix the problem. Take on a series of floors overrun by mysterious enemies known only as "Raven" -- although harmless as long as you can see them, they are deadly if you turn your back.

Playable on the desktop in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. Use your mouse or touchpad to look around, and W/A/S/D or the arrow keys to move.
