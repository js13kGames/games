A short roguelike game about escaping from a castle full of traps.

WASD to move, space to dismiss text.

I completely ran out of time to add all the content I had planned, so the submitted version is only just over 8kb and the route through the castle is heavily truncated.

There is a defined start and end though, and a couple of "puzzles" in the middle, so that counts as a game, right?
