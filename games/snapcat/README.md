SnapCat - Complete the Black Cats' photo album!

- Every level always has a Black Cat.
* Each cat has likes and dislikes, especially about Black Cats.
* Cats may or may not have opinions on other colors, pattern or accessories.
* Cats close to each other influence each otherâ€™s mood; distant cats appear blurred and have little effect.

Goal is to arrange the cats to meet all objectives and capture the perfect group photo.
