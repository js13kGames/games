# Where in Space
The js13k 2021 game by Imagineee: Where in Space?

When you are stuck in space on a bizarre planet

# Playing
First you can install the Pok√©mon font by Super pencil from here: https://github.com/PascalPixel/pokemon-font/blob/v1.8.2/fonts/pokemon-font.ttf (Recommended)

Open open the index.html and get started.

I didn't have any time for music; so, play some space themed adventure music in the background.

NOTE: please zoom in or out if needed to fit in screen due to scaling issues

## Instructions on playing
Use the WASD keys (or arrow keys), to move around.

Use the Space bar to interact with object.

Click to close information panel.

no mobile support, I have a plan to release an alternate release with mobile support
