# VOID Cat

## Overview

VOID Cat is a game/interactive story in which you help a black cat on its weight-loss journey. 

It has _extremely limited deck-building elements_, _grid-based strategy_ on a grid whose out-of-bounds logic actually works this year (probably), and a story that will _shake Js13k to its very core_. 

## Considerations
+ If you read all of the story, VOID Cat might take 10 or so minutes to play. 
+ You can't save the game, so you have to do it all in one go.
