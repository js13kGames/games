Somewhere in an old alley - the Catcher is lurking for the homeless cats. Fortunately, the Catcher has Triskaidekaphobia and is afraid of only one thing in the world: the number 13... so, the only way to save the GANG is to use the ancient CURSE OF 13 CATS!

Rules:

1) Click on the blocks with numbers.
2) Click on the white stacks to put blocks in place.
3) Collect exact 13 points in ONE COLUMN and ONE COLOR using no more than 4 blocks to prepare a CURSE!
4) Reduce the Catcher health points to ZERO to win a game. Watch out for time! After each 4 moves the block pool is reseted.
5) WHITE blocks are JOKERS - they can be used with any previously assigned color in the stack! 

Tips and Tricks: Even if you don't need to match a certain color to get a point - you'll gain bonus time that will help you survive :)
