Stick Skater is a throwback to the old Tony Hawk Pro Skater games. Your goal is to perform sick tricks and complete challenges.

Will you be able to get a million points in less than two minutes?

Coil subscribers get access to the free skate mode, which gets rid of the time limit, allowing for easier challenges and practice for amazing lines!
