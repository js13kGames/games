Flashback to the 1980s!

Nobody wins in this game, but see how long you can go without losing! They've got infinite missiles, and you've got the ability to tap or click on the screen to try and blow up as many of those missiles before they inevitably overwhelm and destroy you. It may not be uplifting, but it is mobile friendly!
