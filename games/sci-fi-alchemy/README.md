All great science fiction has a few elements in common... 

Drag elements into the gray forge area at the top, and drop them on top of each other to look for new combinations. Sometimes elements can combine with themselves.

There are 100 total discoveries, including 13 movies.

Use the arrows on the left to scroll through your list of elements - it'll get pretty long.

Use the trash icon to clear your forge area.

Coil/web-monetization users have hints generated twice as quickly.

Best played on a mobile device!
