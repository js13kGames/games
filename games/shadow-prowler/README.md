Night has fallen, and your true life begins. As a cunning black cat, the world of shadows is your playground and your sanctuary.

In Shadow Prowler, your goal is simple: navigate a series of treacherous rooms to steal every last delicious fish. But you are not just a cat; you are a creature of the night, and your greatest ally is the darkness itself.

Gameplay
Your survival depends on stealth. Stick to the shadows to become invisible, a fleeting specter in the gloom. You must be quick, quiet, and clever to succeed.

The house is not empty. Watchful dogs patrol the floors, their flashlights cutting through the safety of the dark. Get caught in their beam for even a second, and your nightly hunt is over! Race against the clock to secure your prize before time runs out.

Features
1. Classic Stealth Action: Easy to learn but challenging to master. Every step counts!

2. Use the Environment: The level is a puzzle. Use patches of shadow to create a safe path to your goal.

3. Optional Online Mode: You don't have to prowl alone! Connect online to see other players as ghostly cats racing through the same level in real-time. Compete for the best time or simply enjoy the shared, silent hunt.

Sharpen your claws, trust in the shadows, and prove you are the ultimate Shadow Prowler!

Controls: Use the Arrow Keys or WASD to move.
