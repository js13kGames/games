> Mile 13 in the Desert of Doom is feared by all Geckos.
> After all, they know that evil things lurk there
> ...but, Mile 13 is also home to the best donuts.

Can you brave your fear of Mile 13 to munch on sweet treats?

**Drag your finger on the screen to move our little gecko friend.** 
**You can also use the mouse.**

- Collect power-ups to increase firepower.
- Eat all the donuts.
- Defeat the evil dude at the end of the desert.
- Oh, and try to stay alive.

Good luck you'll need it!
