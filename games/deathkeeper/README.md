In this VR game, you play as a grave keeper who must defend the graveyard against hordes of skeletons that have risen from their graves. You will use your precious baseball bat to fend off these undead creatures. Use your flashlight to spot them a bit better in the darkness. Can you survive the night and keep these skeletons from escaping their graves?
