Click or point and drag to cast magick on a spinning slice of toast!

The bigger the move, the more force you will unleash!

There are only two objectives:
1. The toast has to land butter side up
2. The toast has to land in the middle

My interpretation of the theme is the slice of toast having to land on the back side. It was supposed to be a small project, but turned out to be a lot bigger than expected.
