Ever wondered what is happening under the hood of an Asteroids Arcade machine? I can tell you: A greedy evil 25Â¢ money maker engine.

Behind Asteroids is a game about throwing asteroids to people playing "Asteroids" on an arcade machine. Like in Asteroids game, player have 3 extra lifes. The goal is to make the player lose and try to earn as much coins as possible. When a player lose, another come and put a new coin in the arcade.

Players get harder and harder to beat.
