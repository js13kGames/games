Shadow Ball is a game in which you must shoot and kill the never ending armies of the four elements. To the north there is the Air army, to the east the Water army, to the south the Earth army, and to the west the Fire army. Each level adds increasingly more enemies in each room. But you have one advantage: The spirit Orb; providing an endless supply of golden power for you to absorb. But watch out for the deadly mist that protects the enemy territories, and remember to make regular trips back to the Orb to recharge.
