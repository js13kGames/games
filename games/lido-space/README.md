This game was inspired by Qix.
You can choose either the mill or the dots in this game.

Originally planned was to intersect lines of the mill with polygons drawn by the dots.

However, due to the birth of my son, I couldn't complete this feature (although everything is already in place). So instead, the mill tries to create as large as a polyline as possible whereas dots try to navigate through the space without overlapping.

Controlled via arrow keys (opponents), space (host) or on-screen buttons (both). Longer press of space key yields a larger line segment (modulo some division). The button fires right away (and applies some random delay).

I hope it's fun anyway.

I want to add video chat among the players after the judging phase and finalise the features that didn't make it.
