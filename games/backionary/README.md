Backionary word game where you try to guess the written word backwards.

The round starts with one person being selected as the drawer. They draw the given word like normal using their mouse (sorry no mobile support, I ran out of time). Then once done, everyone else races to guess the word as its slowly redrawing backwards. First to guess the word gets the points. Points are lost for incorrect guess or if everyone fails to guess the word. 

NOTE: This game only really works when there are multiple players.
