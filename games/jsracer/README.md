JSRACER is a drone racing game.
You start each track with an countdown.
Rings on the course allows you to add time.

When you pass a checkpoint, a time bar increases. When it is full, you can decide to empty it by pressing space.
This will take you back to the track a few seconds earlier so you can better negotiate a missed turn.

Will you manage to arrive at the end of each track?

Controls:
Arrows key to drive and select track
Space to activate the backtime
