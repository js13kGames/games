Based on Miyamoto Musashi's book "Go Rin No Sho" ("The Book of Five Rings") and the life of the famous swordsman himself.

The game recreates an imaginary Musashi's journey through Japan to meet Miyake Gunbei, Honda Tadamasa's vassal, to prove him his mastery as a swordsman. Mushashi must survive to a 113 Ri tour before meeting his final enemy, while fighting other skilled Ronin who are eager to confront him, as well as hunger and exhaustion.

If Musashi is able to take advantage of the Godai (the Japanese five great elements: earth, water, fire, wind and void), he will proclaim himself as the greatest swordsman of all time.

13 Days, 13 enemies and 113 Ri come between Miyamoto and the way of the Godai.
