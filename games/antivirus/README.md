In the era when internet was not everywhere, we all used various offline storage devices to save our precious data. But viruses corrupted our data so many times. Out objective is to go into those devices and kill those viruses.

This game has 3 stages:
1) Floppy
2) CD
3) Pendrive

You can directly jump to any stage you want but it's recommended to start from level one.
Have fun!

Controls:
Use the arrow keys to move and Spacebar to shoot. It takes 6 hits to kill a virus but you have to be fast as they can heal over time!
