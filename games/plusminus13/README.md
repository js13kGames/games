**13** is bad, but can be good too. Just like this game. Probably needs a non-potato computer and mobile is not supported.

**WASD** or arrow keys for movement, **spacebar** for shield.

Music theme by Zarja. Play testing: Aleks and Zarja. Thank you!

This is a tech demo of sorts, of a global illumination approach developed by Alexander Sannikov, called radiance cascades. This particular game's engine is a raw WebGL port of Jason McGhee's Three.js based [blog post](https://jason.today/rc). I'll be releasing this mini engine as standalone soon.
