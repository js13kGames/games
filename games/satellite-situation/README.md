You control a spaceship that has to deliver some satellites to planets, but every time a satellite is located you have less space to locate the remaining satellites.

To win the game you must locate all the satellites safely without any of them colliding with an already placed one.

Controls
> A/D keys or Left/Right arrows -> Move spaceship

> Spacebar -> Shoot satellite to planet
