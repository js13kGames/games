You're a detective at the Black Cat Detective Agency: don't even think about crossing us! You get a text from a client asking you to catch some naughty dogs committing crimes! Even though you don't have thumbs, you'll do your best to catch these misbehaving canines! 

## How to Play 🐈‍⬛
After getting through the main screen and into the 3D portion, click the screen and move your mouse to look around!  You can also use the arrow keys or `WASD`, but I would recommend using the mouse! 🐭

## About the Game 🕵🏻‍♂️
This is the first WebGL game I've ever made, and it was a blast learning everything! Here are some very helpful sources during the process:

- ❤️ The [WebGL Fundamentals](https://webglfundamentals.org/) site was immensely helpful
- ❤️ I used the [LittleJS](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS/tree/js13k) build script as a reference!
- ❤️ I used [ZzFx](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/ZzFX) for sound! (I love that library!!!)
- ❤️ This [WebGL linting](https://github.com/greggman/webgl-lint) library was very helpful, especially in the beginning!

I also added comments linking to tutorials and guides I utilized throughout the code!

## Easter Eggs! 🍳
Make sure to take your time and look around- there are fun little things all over the game to discover!

Thank you for playing!!! 📸 🥰
