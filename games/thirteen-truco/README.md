Clone of the classic card game Truco! One major difference: a card numbered 13!

This card loses to any other card. However, it mimics any card in the deck until you play it. Only when you drop it does it reveal it as a 13.

You might think you have a strong hand, only to discover that you were better off not raising the stakes with such a weak card.

But beware - don't let triskaidekaphobia get the best of you!

## How to Play

The game is played with four players: two opponents and one teammate, whom you can distinguish by their colors.

At the start of each round, you receive three cards. To play a card, drag it forward to drop it into the current round. The other players will do the same.

The highest card wins that step of the round. Next steps starts *by the player who won the last step*. Repeat this process until all cards are played. You win the round if:

* You win two steps.
* You win the 1st step and draw in either the 2nd or 3rd step.
* You draw the 1st step and win the next step.

You can also drag a card backward to discard it as a hidden card and hide your strategy.

## Card Hierarchy

The cards are ranked as follows, from lowest to highest: **13, 4 to 7, Q, J, K, 1, 2, and 3**.

## Trump Cards

In each round, a "turned card" determines the trump cards - cards that beat all others. The trump card is the card immediately following the turned card in rank.

Unlike regular cards, trump cards don't tie. They override all other cards and each other, depending on suit. The suit order is as follows: diamonds, spades, hearts, and clubs.

* **Turned card: 4 → Trump cards: 5♦, 5♠, 5♥, 5♣**
* **Turned card: 7 → Trump cards: Q♦, Q♠, Q♥, Q♣**
* **Turned card: 3 → Trump cards: 4♦, 4♠, 4♥, 4♣ (instead of 13 - remember, triskaidekaphobia)**

## Raising the Stakes

If you think you have strong cards, you can raise the stakes! Each round typically awards one point, but raising the stakes increases the value to **3, 6, 9, or even 12 points**.

The 1st making 12 points wins!
