ðŸ•¹**Controls**: `WASD`, `ZQSD` or `Arrows` and follow the instructions on each micro-game

In **story mode**, each boss has a set of fast paced micro-games to play. Your progress will be saved so you don't have to repeat from the first boss if you die.
In **endless mode**, you can play all 13 levels in increasing difficulty and in random order.
