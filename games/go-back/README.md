you can play only with mouse.
When you start the game, a path of yellow cells will be drawn, after seconds, it will disappear, you have to go back from the last cell to the first one but on the same path, if you choose the right cell, it will turn to green, if you choose a cell on the path but not the next one, it will turn to light blue, if you choose the wrong one, it will turn to "X".
you can always get a hint .. there is no time limits.
