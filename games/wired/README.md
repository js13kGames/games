This is a turn by turn game. Main goal is to pick up all coins of your color in right order, and kill your enemies. There are two teams, blue and red, and 2 players in each team. Can be played against CPU or another human.
In every turn you got two dices thrown, you move both players, and you can choose what player will play what dice. When you finish moves for one of the players, if some enemy player is on the same line (vertical or horizontal), you will electrify him, and he will go back to the field where he picked up his last coin. If you already complete all coins, you now have an electroshocker, then you will kill that enemy, and when you kill both of them, you are the winner.
