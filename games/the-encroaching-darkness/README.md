Earn the most points at the end of 16 rounds

## How to Play

* Each round you choose a Tile to place.
* Each Tile has a building (the image), a value (the number), and a shape.
* You cannot place a Tile if any part of its shape overlaps the __Darkness__, __Forest__, __Mountain__, or another building or shape.
* Press "R" to rotate the shape, or press the "Rotate Tile" button below the Tiles.
* When placing a Tile, if the total value of all buildings in the same row or column as the placed building is equal to or great than 13, the __Darkness__ will grow.
* At the end of every round the __Darkness__ will grow.
* _Be aware_ that __Darkness__ can overtake other tiles and even your buildings (removing them from the board) unless you have a __Light Tower__ nearby. A building that is covered by __Darkness__ does not score points or contribute to points of other Tiles.
* On round 13 the __Darkness__ will grow twice.
* For scoring purposes, nearby and adjacency is calculated _using the building square_ (the image) and not the shape of the Tile.
