# BLACK CAT - NINE LIVES NO MERCY

## STORY

You are special operator, codename Black-Cat. You have been assigned by high command to proceed with all possible haste (stopping only to fiddle with catnip-mice and balls of wool) to the Pyrasian system, where the native Pyra's claim they are being harrassed by the forces of some bad guy that we can't even remember the name of. Liberate the Pyra's special operator Black-Cat, and destroy your enemies, although they may just be innocent space explorers. We don't know for sure but let's err on the side of caution and crush them with paws of steel.

There was a lot more to add here but I did not realize that it is limited to only 2Kb of text :(
