Tony must send selfies to his followers on the internet to document his day at the local shopping mall. His mom is picking him up in 1 hour so he must gain as many likes as possible before she arrives.
When the trolls see that you have a signal they will try and get to it also, too many users at a wifi hotspot will drop the signal and you will be 'Offline'. The lower the trolls using your hotspot the more likes you are likely to get.
Haters will chase you, and may send dislikes about your selfies.
