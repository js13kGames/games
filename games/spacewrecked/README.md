During a routine observation around a newly discovered planet, your spaceship suddenly got struck by an unknown force decimating your entire vehicle. Sending you straight down to the surface of this odd place.
You blacked out...
After you woke up you noticed you were surrounded by strange creatures, trying to eat you. 

Your only chance to escape is to fight the creatures and trying to find the 5 lost pieces of your ship.

You can move around by gazing at the ground next to your character. 

Good luck!
