Hi :) Few months ago I heard about 13kgames on MeetJS in Katowice. Together with collage we got inspired and decided to organise this kind of competition between few developers, based on the same rules. We chose a cathegory "carnivorous" back then.  Current contest category may have nothing in common, however I decided that it's a pity not to show you game inspired to create by you :)

So about the game:
You are a little hungry plant that want to survive, left in the kitchen. Your owner is cooking and many delicious food is flying around the kitchen! Basic rule is to eat! But don't eat vegetables (it's cannibalism)! Enjoy!
