## The Story So Far
In Rocket Jockey, you take on the role of Captain Pick a Card and have to pilot your ramshackle ship to the edge of an asteroid field.

Unfortunately, your ship's systems are barely held together. You'll only have a limited amount of options you can use every turn.

## Playing cards
Play a card by selecting the card along the bottom of the grid. Click on the circles on the grid to play it. You must play two cards every turn.

## Asteroids
Asteroids will move their speed value (the number on the asteroid) each turn after you play cards. Running into asteroids will kill you. Asteroids running into you will kill you.

## Recycle
Each turn you can recycle one card. This will let discard the currently selected card and draw a replacement card for free.
