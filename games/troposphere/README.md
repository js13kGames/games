TROPOSPHERE

You are lost in a metropolis in a foreign planet.
You need to find your way to back home by
using portals and climbing higher into Troposphere.
 
Controls
Use ARROWS or W/A/S/D to move.  For normal jump, use UP or W (when not climbing)
Press SPACE or G for anti-gravity jump and you will jump higher and longer!
Hold T for time traveling back in time (uses lots of energy!)

Tips
Use anti-gravitation jump to get to ladders above you. Save energy for it!
If drone is following you, you can lose it by going away from it and it will stop following you.
