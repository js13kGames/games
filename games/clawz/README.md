CLAWZ: (Im)prove your catness

In a distant future most black cats have been eradicated since they are considered bad luck. 

Only a handful of black cats have survived, by training and honing their fighting skills in CLAWZ: the Cat Learning Augmented War Zone, an advanced XR environment.

You are one of the last black cats alive. Use your claws to slice virtual targets in order boost your cat reflexes. The more the slices, the higher the score, the greater your chances to survive as a black cat.

Different target colors have different effects as you'll soon find out. Get slicing!
