The Game is an asteroids homage. It is the Dark Souls of space games. Super hard to get to the end. Survive for 5 minutes while asteroids bump into you and enemies try to destroy you. Protect planets from falling asteroids and escort helpless travelers. Accumulate points by dodging lasers and making them hit asteroids. Make enemies follow you into a asteroid belt or meteor storm and let them destroy themselves. Do all this for 5 minutes and fight The Boss of Space! And then BACK to work.

W,A,D or Arrow keys to move.
P to Pause.
BackSpace to retry
Shift to enter Dream State :P

I wanted to make a game for worker bees that need to get re-energized for the day. Something to get the blood pumping. Enjoy!
