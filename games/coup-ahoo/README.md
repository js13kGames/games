You're finally fed up with your fleet and their incompetence. Take down all 13 of them one by one and claim your spot at the top. Along the way, you'll discover precious cargo dice that represent your ship's vitality and firepower. You may also encounter friendly merchants, carpenters, and potential crew members eager to join and assist you on your journey.

The game is played entirely with a mouse (or touch). You can mute the game by pressing M.

Your ship's cargo consists of dice, and their total pip values represent your ship's total HP. These dice also influence the number of damage dice you roll in combat. Be careful not to let your cargo's total value reach the dreaded number, as even rolling that in combat can have unfavorable consequences.
