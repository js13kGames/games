PUZZLEggs is a puzzle game where you control a bird who want to get his/her eggs back. The goal is to collect every egg in the stage and then return to the starting position. You may not stomp the eggs you have already collected, so try not to get stuck!

The game includes 13 stages and a password system to "store" your progress.

Controls:
- Arrows keys: Move
- R: Restart stage
- F: Toggle fullscreen
- Enter: accept things in menus, or open the pause menu

Works best on Chrome or Opera, should have good enough performance on Firefox, although if you are using Linux like I do, the game might be a little laggy, so I advise using Opera or Chrome.
