# Shadow Alley 🐾🌙

You are a stray black cat wandering the rainy backstreets of the city. Hungry and alone, you sneak through the night in search of fish — but the alleys are guarded by lamps and watch dogs. Only stealth and patience will keep you safe.

## 🎮 Controls
- Arrow Keys / WASD → Move
- Enter Door → Escape to the next level

## 🐟 Goal
Collect all the fish in each alley and reach the glowing door to progress.

## ⚡ Challenge
- Avoid the light of street lamps — once caught, there’s no way back.
- Stay out of sight from the guard dogs and their patrols.
- Use hiding spots to wait for the right moment to slip by.

## 🌧️ Story

The rain never ends, the lamps burn cold, and the streets are filled with danger. Yet hope drives you forward — every fish brings you closer to surviving another night in the Shadow Alley.
