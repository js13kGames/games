Lost in my mind - js13kb
-----------------
A VR game about being lost in ones mind as if in a dream. You see your thoughts form in front of you.

You manipulate your internal monologue to form new thoughts that move you on a journey through your mind.

Controls:
Point and click fuse-based cursor.
If you make a mistake, use the red delete cube to undo.

A live link can be found here:

Aframe was a dream to use, check it out, my only complaint is the default mouse drag behaviour for the controls.

[A work in progress sadly not even close to being finished].
