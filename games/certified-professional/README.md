Certified Professional is a game of teamwork and multitasking. You are working with your partner, helping one another to repair a broken power line while also watching out for hazards.

The Line Worker is the fastest around when it comes to repairing wires, but is blind and cannot see approaching power surges or avoid the aggressive birds of the region!

The Ground Worker has excellent aim, and keeps attacking birds off the line worker, but is deaf and cannot hear approaching trains. Unfortunately the best vantage point is right on the tracks!

It's up to you to warn your partner of approaching danger, and to watch for your partners warnings so you can react appropriately!

This is a server game and requires two players. You can also open it in two windows to play both players yourself for even more multi-tasking challenge.

Controls are different depending on whether you are the Ground Worker or Line Worker. Read instructions on main page before readying up.
