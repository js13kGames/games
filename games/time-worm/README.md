You are the Time Worm! Your job is to destroy as many little grey men as possible. Your health is represented by the number of your body's segments, plus your head. There are no health pickups here, but if you get hit or make another mistake you can rewind time for 5 seconds and try again! Plus there's the traditional option of firing right back with your laser-firing sunglasses!
