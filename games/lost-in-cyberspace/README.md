Lost in CYBERSPACE is a cooperative game designed for 2 players, each playing on a separate device. The only connection you need between each other is your voice. You can be in the same room or on the other part of the world, as long as you can hear each other.

One player takes a role of a HACKER lost in the CYBERSPACE maze of a corporate network. They need to move around CYBERSPACE, read the access codes to NAVIGATOR and find the TARGET node to hack it. But beware! Hacking wrong nodes will make you easier to locate and you will be lost in CYBERSPACE when the time runs out!

The other player takes a role of a NAVIGATOR who uses a terminal to decode the access codes they got from HACKER, read the map of CYBERSPACE and help HACKER find the way to the TARGET node.
