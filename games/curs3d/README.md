You've been cursed to live forever. You were alive for 13kb years (People still using punch cards and dealing with real-life bugs). Since now you have found the totem of dying, the wizard of Javascriptsu commands the army to keep you alive and crush the totem.

Don't let them destroy it; it grants power to the holder and itself.

# Commands
W,A,S,D: Walk, Left, Right, Down
Z,X,C: Skill
Space: Basic Attack
