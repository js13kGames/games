A fast-paced RTS game about conquering the moon.

Use arrows to change your selection and press 1, 2, or 3 to build.
The goal is to destroy the enemy command center.
Command centers do nothing, but they generate a large territory.
Inside your territory, you can build turrets, to attack enemy buildings, and refineries, to increase your helium-3 reserves.
You cannot build in mountains. A part from that, they do not have any effect in the game.
