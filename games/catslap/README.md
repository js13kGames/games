You've been trapped by a black cat that wants to paw you to death! Block its paws using your hands, listening for its 'meows' around you.

- You have 3 lives
- Listen for the cat's sound cues!
- The cat might get faster as time goes on :)
- Survive as long as you can!

Spatial audio implemented using the WebAudio API. Hand tracking supported. There seems to be a bug with Meta browser where your controllers don't show up immediately when entering VR, you may have to tap the Meta button.
