Fly through space blasting enemies and collecting power orbs. Orbs fill your energy meter and power up your guns. Fully power the meter to win. 

Firing weapons, and colliding with enemies and bullets will temporarily deplete your meter. Fully deplete your meter and your ship will go offline until it recharges. Take a hit while offline and it's game over.
