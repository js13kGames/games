Your ship has mysteriously crashed on a desolate planetoid. The damage is extensive, everything is OFFLINE, and you'll need to repair many of your systems before you can launch. Luckily you ship can auto-repair itself, and sensors detected some depots of fuel and parts on this planetoid, perhaps left by the previous inhabitants. Good luck!
