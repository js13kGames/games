Arrow keys to move (green)
Collect treasure (yellow)
Glitch portals (red) allow you to move everywhere in the Upside Down
However in the Upside Down, you are being chased
The beast (white) is chasing you everywhere but can only attack in the Upside Down
If it catches you, you die
If you glitch into a wall, you die
Good luck.
