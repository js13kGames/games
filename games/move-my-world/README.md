In this puzzle game, you don't move around to get to your destination, but rather you get your destination to get to you!

*HOW TO PLAY*
-Tap/Click on the arrows on either side of the screen to rotate the world in that specific direction.
-Avoid the hazards and try to reach the end.

*NOTES*
-The game is tested and works well on:
desktop(Chrome) , android(S3 , Tab4) on iOS(iPod4)
-Unfortunately due to being busy with other stuff , I haven't had the time to either add enough content or finalize this game the way I wanted it to be, however there is a level builder you can use to make your own levels, if you like:
