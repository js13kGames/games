There is one invisible square on the map
You must find it by moving the mouse on the canvas
When you hover i, the pointer become green and the opacity start to increase
Click on it to validate the point
You must avoid the moving ball
Each new point increase speed and size of the ball but decrease size of the cursor

Good luck!
