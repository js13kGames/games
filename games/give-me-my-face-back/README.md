Your face has been sliced off in a horrific memory leak... retrieve it using the power of glitches!

In each level you will construct a path using the mouse cursor's glitchiness, then click when you're ready to run and catch your face. Use the mouse cursor to nudge yourself upwards if you get stuck. For each piece of your face you miss, you lose a little piece of your sanity. You lose the game when you run out of sanity.

Good luck!
