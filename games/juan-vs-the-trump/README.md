Our hero is Juan. His desires in life are simple: collect coins and stay alive. His lifelong rival is the Trump, who just likes to screw everything up.

Help Juan navigate the floating platforms to collect coins. But be careful: some platforms have deadly spikes and the Trump shows up every so often to scare you and reverse the direction of the platforms.
