# Mewnbeam’s Adventure

Build your deck, battle enemies, and defeat the Rat King in this magical roguelike deckbuilder.

If you're a frequent roguelike-deckbuilder player, the game is designed so that you can learn as you go. If you don't know what a card does, try it out! If you prefer a little more foresight, some notable information is below.

## How to Play

At the start of every turn you reset to 2 **Actions** (pink diamond) and gain 1 **Mana** (blue circle). Mana is carried over between turns, but Actions are not.

Actions and Mana are used to play cards. Each card lists its cost in the top left.

1. Click or drag a card to play it
2. Repeat step 1
3. Click 'End Turn' when you're done playing cards
4. Good luck!

* [space] will end your turn
* [esc] will get you out of card menus, or cancel the selected card

Cards will unlock in your Library the first time you add them to your deck. (Generating a card during a battle will not unlock it.)
