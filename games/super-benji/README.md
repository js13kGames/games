## Gameplay/Features

- Fight your way through waves of enemies
- Upgrade your ship with Torx's item upgrades after every zone
- Death isn’t the end! Maggie lets Benji gamble his 9 lives for a twist on your next run
- Face a tricky boss in the story and even tougher "Uber version" every 3 levels after
- Hardcore Boss Challenge: After your first play through, there's an exhange to risk it all with a warp straight to the Rift Horizon - an insane fight from level 1 (I still haven't beaten it)

## Story

The ruthless warlord known as the Iron Jackal has stolen the Warp Core - an artifact with the power to twist space and time itself. With the galaxy hanging in the balance, only one reckless pilot dares to hunt him down… Benji!

Join Benji, Maggie the strategist, and Torx the engineer as you blast across starfields, dive through unstable war zones, and chase the Jackal into the heart of cosmic distortion. The further you pursue him, the more reality itself unravels—stars ripple, space bends, and time breaks apart.

Upgrade your ship, take down swarms of enemies, and gamble with Benji's nine lives as you carve your fate among the cosmos. Every bargain could make you stronger… or push you closer to doom.

Will you bring the Iron Jackal to justice and reclaim the Warp Core - or lose everything in the void?

**The hunt is on. The galaxy won’t wait.**

## Notes

This is my 2nd js13k entry. I wanted to focus more on the visuals and music this time and I quickly hit the 13k limit - so some music, dialog, items, and exchanges had to be cut. I enjoyed creating the artwork and soundtrack the most. The theme is based on games from the Snes era like Starfox, Super Aleste and Super R-Type.

I hope you enjoy playing it!
