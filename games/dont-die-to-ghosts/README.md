Don't Die To Ghosts is a 2 dimensional side view game inspired by the classic arcade game Pac-Man.

The aim of Don't Die To Ghosts is to complete successive levels (to beat the best score) by munching all the dots (244 of them), munching the bonus fruit (nom nom), and trying not to Die To Ghosts (eek).

There are two power pills per level which enable the player to munch ghosts for a short time, and like Pac-Man, the player can leave either side of the screen and reappear on the opposite side.

Controls:
- Z or LEFT ARROW to move left.
- X or RIGHT ARROW to move right.
- On mobile devices tap the LEFT and RIGHT sides of the screen to move.

Don't Die To Ghosts is best enjoyed in full-screen mode with some chip music playing in the background.

Don't Die To Ghosts has been tested working in Firefox and Chrome web browsers on Windows10 laptop, and Chrome and DuckDuckGo on an Android device. Mileage might vary with other browsers, devices, and operating systems.
