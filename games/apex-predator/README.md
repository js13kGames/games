The goal is for the player and all characters other than the Reaper to die.
Game operations are RIGHT, LEFT, UP, DOWN only.
The order of strength is as follows.
ã€€grass < zebra < lion < man, woman < reaper
A character with a higher strength cannot be defeated.
However, you can induce the Shinigami to defeat them.
If you aim to clear the game with grass, wisdom, operation skills and luck will be required.
