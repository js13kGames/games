Asteroids Extended is a small exploration game. It can be controlled with arrow keys and Space to fire. On mobile, click the screen to show overlay buttons. Use "f" for forwards and "w" for weapon to control the ship.

The player does not need to fear dying as none of the objects have collision.

The map has an asteroid field and four planets. The player can shoot the asteroids and fling through space using the gravity of the planets.

I consider continuing development after the jam, so you may want to check the Gitlab page for the most recent version. In honour of its origin, I intend to keep all versions within 13 kilobytes.
