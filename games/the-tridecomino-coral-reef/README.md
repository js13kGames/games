The controls are just tapping and mouse.

I wanted to design prettier tiles, but ran out of time.
There is is also no sound, so do not panic, your speakers/headphones are ok.
I think it's kinda playable, but not more than just a prototype.
Only worked on this during the first few days of the jam and then I had other stuff to attend to.

I tried to leave the copilot prompts in the source code as much as possible.

Here is the text of the startscreen in case it doesn't fit on your screen.

```The Tridecomino Coral Reef.
This mysterious reef is constantly
changing, but somehow the shape is
always a polyomino of 13 squares.

The many tourist boats are damaging
the reef. It is your job to chase
them away by gently tapping on them.

Boats can only move back and forth.
Red boats are above the reef.
White boats are not above the reef.

If there are no red boats left,
the reef is safe.

Good luck!

Tap on the boat to start...
