Another little story of triangle man! Can you try to get out of cave? It isn't that easy as you think. 

Controls:
ArrowLeft, A - Move left;
ArrowRight, D - Move right;
ArrowUp, W - Jump;
ArrowDown, S - While jumping you hit the ground and damage enemies around (It works only if you have enough stamina);â€¨

Space, Enter - Fight;

1, 2, 3, 4 - Switch between graphics quality;

M - Mute;

P.S. For me it works well with high res only in Chrome. For better playing experience in other browsers I would suggest to try to reduce the graphics quality with 1, 2, 3, 4 num keys.
