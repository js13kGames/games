Every Halloween the 13 witches of Whimsywick cast a Halloween party spell, bringing the jack-o-lanterns to life and creating magical bubbles across the town. But this year the spell went wrong! The witches are trapped in the bubbles and the jack-o-lanterns are running wild!

Only the witches' faithful familiar Whiskers can save them now!
