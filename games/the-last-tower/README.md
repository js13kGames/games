Mongolian invaders are coming from every direction. You won't give up and will defend the last tower till the last drop of blood.

Movement: WASD. Attack: left mouse button (point the cursor in the direction of the enemy you want to attack).

Goal is to defend the tower and staying alive as long as you can.

The tower is helping you out by shooting projectiles at the enemies. The worse the health of the tower, the less damage it deals. You can heal the tower by killing the invaders. You can also heal yourself by avoiding being attacked for a few seconds.
