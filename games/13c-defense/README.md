While thinking about the theme of the 13th century, I thought about making a game related to the Mongol army. I was inspired by battles involving Mongol troops in the 13th century, including the Battle_of_Cheoin.

Like a typical defense game, enemies (Mongolians) move along a set path. Eliminate enemies before they approach the gate.

Movement is done using the arrow keys, and when leveling up, abilities are selected using the number keys 1, 2, and 3.
