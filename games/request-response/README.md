Website server simulator.

You are the man behind a server and must response to all requests as quickly as posible. Send the correct files on time and they wont fire you. A bad request? Don't worry, you have your always useful 404.html file with you.

To play: drag the files (with your mouse) on the right column and drop them in the requests in the right column.
