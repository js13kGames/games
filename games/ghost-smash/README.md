Ghost Smash is a type of whack-a-mole game where you catch ghosts and earn scores! 
Sometimes these ghosts will cast black magic on you so you can only see a dark screen but just keep catching them!  

My entry for js13k, the game size itself is 11kb, except for the NEAR-SDK-JS part ^^ 

## How to play 

Point and click, catch Back Ghost and Green Ghost, and avoid the red one!

Type of Ghosts:
- Black Ghost: +1 score
- Green Ghost: +1 score & +2 seconds
- Red Ghost: -2 score & -2 seconds
