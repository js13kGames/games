The government has taken baby-zilla away! They hid it somewhere in the city. You have 4 claws on one hand, a mouth that spits fire, and 4 claws on the other hand. It's FOUR-ROAR-FOUR time!

ROAR is a WebXR experience written entirely in vanilla JS. It doesn't use A-Frame, Babylon, nor Three.js. All of it is less than 13 KB zipped.

You're a monster wreaking havoc in a city. Your goal is to find baby-zilla in one of the buildings â€” and destroy the city in the process.

Controls:

Pull the TRIGGER button to active the fire breath.
Squeeze the GRIP button to grab buildings.
Use the JOYSTICK to move around.
Avoid the missiles!
