In typical platformers you have to avoid enemies, avoid pits, collect stuffs, stay alive as long as possible and be happy.

"Please, Die" is not the typical platformer. Things are kind of reversed here, so you have to help our little character with a very simple task: to die.

Best experience on Chrome and Firefox. Run on Internet Explorer under your own risk ;)
