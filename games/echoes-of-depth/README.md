You are the Ninja falling down a hole to fight demons. 
You encounter demons and loot along the way.
Dodge the demons and collect loot at the same time.
Left arrow to turn clockwise and Right Arrow to turn anti-clockwise.
Collect as many points as possible.
The game is unfinished because I cannot recreate the falling effect. Plus it suppose to have audio but I don't have time to get and implement that.
