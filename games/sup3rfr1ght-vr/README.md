Confront some of the 13 meanest geometric shapes you've ever met in this SUPERHOT VR clone made with AFRAME.

## Controls

- Time moves only when you move your hands, head or body.
- Press the Grip button to grab objects.

Only playable with 6DoF VR headsets (Quest 1/2/3, Vive, Rift?)

NOTE: When hit by an enemy, the RETRY portal will reload the page. Unfortunately, since the game is embedded into an iframe of the js13k site, this will exit the VR session and force you to re-enter VR mode.
