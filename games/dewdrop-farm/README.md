Welcome to Dewdrop Farm!

Buy some seeds. Till the soil. Plant your crops. Water them daily. Pet the bunny. Harvest your crops. Sell for profit. Rinse and repeat.

Buy new tools. Watch the seasons. Take a break. Exploit the market. Buy a cow. Feed your cow. Shovel cow poop. It's your farm!

If you're playing on mobile, touch controls work. If you're playing on desktop, keys 1 through 6 change the active inventory slot. Keys F for farm, B for buy, S for sell, and I for info, change the active screen.

Coil subscribers get a bonus to luck!
