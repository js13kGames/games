## How does it implement the theme?

The theme inspired us to build a deckbuilder with a twist: you can only ever have exactly 12 cards in your deck. When choosing new cards for your deck, you don’t add them, making the deck larger (and slower). Instead, you exchange one of the cards already in the deck for the new card.  You could say your deck is superstitious and *really doesn’t want to have 13 cards*. 

## Why is there no sound?

Look, we both know you’re going to play this game at work, or maybe while putting your youngest to sleep. We could have added some audio, but you’d play the game on mute anyways, and we’d need to drop a few cards to make room for the sound data. Plus, we’d need to also squeeze in the logic to toggle the music. Which you’d promptly switch to OFF. So instead, enjoy the extra cards and go build those sweet combos!
