I have a phobia that is very close to Triskaidekaphobia, and it involves a plumber, a princess, a castle and a speaking mushroom...

Discover it in this mini-game, or more precisely, this little tech demo, in which my challenge was to recreate the exterior of a childhood game as accurately as possible in 13kb, by mixing 10 different tools that I developed during the past 10 years (3D framework, texture generator, emoji polyfill, MIDI parser, piano synth, 3D platform engine, 3D map editor, JS inputs handler, speech synth and sound effects editor).

For once, the source code is readable and commented!

Controls: click to start / WASD or ZQSD or arrow keys to move.

The game should work on most browsers and devices but the best results are on Windows + Webkit browser (Edge or Chrome)
