Tribes Life is a simulator of small island. It's simulates life of the primitive tribes. They eat, reproduce, build houses.

Player can expand the land and show tribes hints of places where they should move (e.g. for food).

I don't manage to finish game on time. I made the prototype with lots of gameplay and then rewrite whole game on new engine and nice graphics. This consumes a lot of time and effort.
