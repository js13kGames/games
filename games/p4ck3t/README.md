Overview
You are a small packet who just connected to an archaic network. The server is unhappy you've arrived, but you have to retrieve some data and your up-beat attitude can't be crushed.

Environments
This game is playable on Desktop Chrome and Firefox, as well as mobile Chrome and Firefox

Controls
To move across a network line, click or tap to the left or right of the packet, or use the left or right arrow keys.

To jump to a unconnected network line, click or tap above or below the packet, or use the up and down arrow keys.

When connecting a network use the mouse, keyboard or touch to click or tap tiles and rotate them and establish a connection.
