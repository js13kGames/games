This is a management sim.

You have recently come to acquire a little pet shop selling black cats to witches. Navigate your way through life by selling cats, expanding your list of witch customers and preventing your downfall at the hands of those dam bills. Make sure to match cat traits with witch traits and know that there are spells out there that you can acquire to make bigger plays.
