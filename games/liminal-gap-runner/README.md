Welcome to the World of Liminal Gap.

Evil corporations have taken control of our data and placed it all in the cloud. Personal data possession is illegal now.

Only you, the Liminal Gap Runner, can save the day by traversing abandoned spaces looking for data, and uploading it to private FTP servers. Lucky for us, the Liminal Gap Plumber Union is not part of the Cartel. They control the Liminal Gap jump pads and allow data couriers like yourself to use them in exchange for data uploads.

So keep enough data to use the jump pads. But be careful! Do not exceed your capacity! Maybe famous data couriers like Johnny could carry 80 or even 160 GB. But you should never exceed your 13MB limit, or you'll have a very bad day. Always upload excess data.


## Controls

WASD - Movement
Mouse or Cursor Keys - Look around


## Jump Pads
Active jump pads are orange and can be used to upload data along your jump across the liminal gap. You need some data to be collected to unlock them. And they're single use only - after the upload jump they will not be active again.
Consider that while planning your route across the Liminal Gap!
