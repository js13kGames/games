Help emojis beat death by using cryonics!
This is an open ended puzzle game made as a tribute to Zachtronics games.

The game is controlled entirely by mouse/touch.

Instructions:
Place machines to freeze all emojis and move them into cryochambers (blue circles).

Large arrow: Moves object on it to next tile
Small arrow: Pushes an object in front of it to next tile
Blue diamond: Freezes object
White diamond: Unfreezes object
Red hexagon(in level editor): Simply blocks objects

Note:
Objects when frozen will get joined to any frozen objects near it.
The frozen objects must cover all cryochambers at the same time to get stored.
