What happens when you mix Tetris with cats? You get Catris: a fur-midable puzzle game where every falling piece is an adorable (and slightly uncooperative) kitty.

Stack the colorful cats into perfect lines to clear space, but watch out for the mysterious black cats. They’re not here to help. They have minds of their own! Some are too stubborn to move, others refuse to rotate no matter how much you ask, and a few are so impatient they drop straight to the bottom before you can even blink.

Every meow-ment counts as the board fills up faster than a cardboard box at a cat café. You’ll need quick paws, clever thinking, and a good sense of humor to survive the chaos.

Will you tame the feline frenzy, or will the black cats bring you purr-mature game over?
