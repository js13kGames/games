A hacker develops a virus to destroy her company's network after being unfairly fired. She falls asleep after 2 days working non-stop and spills her favourite Energy Drink, which slips in the machine and makes you - the virus - conscient. While using the help of some friends and avoiding the security measures, you must get to the outside world to destroy all communications before the computer dies.
