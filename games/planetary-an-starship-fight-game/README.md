This game is a realtime multiplayer game based on WebRTC.

If you create a room, send the URL to your friends.

Wins who survive the fight. You have 3 lifes. You need constantly energy from the star, so stay near to fast reload, if you go far away you'll die without life support. The good news is you can't be found when you are far enough.

* Left and Right arrows: Rotate the ship.
* Up arrow: Accelerate the ship.
* Down arrow: slow down the ship.
* Space bar: Launch guided missiles. (long press to give more energy to the missile, so it'll last longer to seek your enemies)

In space, lack of friction is your worst enemy. Use the DOWN ARROW to brake and facilitate maneuvers.

You can land a planet to auto-fix damages in your ship.

Your people will send some aid boxes with extra missiles. Go get then!
