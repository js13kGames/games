You must stop the caravan from reaching Acre. You must kill all knights and the Caravan, but you only have 20 arrows, and a bunch of knights.

Use WSAD to move your knight.
Aim by holding right mouse button, shoot with left mouse.
You can switch knights using Space.

I runned out of space too soon so I had to cut content to fit the limit and the gameplay suffered (I even had to chop one arm of the knights!). I hope you enjoy it.
