## Challenges

Embrace the challenges

### Decentralized

- OP Guild Challenge
    - NPCs which gives the bubble a makeover
- Avalanche Challenge
    - Created my own ERC721 Smart Contract, and deployed it to [Avalanche](https://snowtrace.io/token/0xcA61C32f3912b3882fB488eBF44F8275f41faFf1)
    - Fetch 3 NFTs from the contract, which acts as NPCs to give the bubble some colors
- Thirdweb Challenge
    - Use the [Thirdweb Typescript SDK](https://portal.thirdweb.com/typescript/v5)
    - Use the SDK to fetch my 3 NFTs from the Avalanche blockchain
    - Use the SDK to fetch bonus levels from Pinata (IPFS)
        - For example: [Bonus 1](https://apricot-tasty-peacock-500.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmaGn65fZnKw25fqYGNqpzpjsXmnLGUdRPs5cvFEkquNnQ)
- Arcadia Challenge
    - Upload the same game to [Arcadia](https://arcadia.fun/),  [Bubble Burst](https://arcadia.fun/games/e9f4fa30-8dea-4c4a-b525-b36c0202d972/)

The player has to click the "Web3" button in the game to see the challenges. Clicking "Web3" will dynamically import the Thirdweb TypeScript SDK, and fetch NFTs (My NPCs) from Avalancnhe, and bonus levels from IPFS.
Clicking on any of my NPCs will change the color of the bubble

If the game for some reason is not able to fetch the NPCs when you click web3, try the web3 version of the game [here](https://bubbleburst.reitgames.com?referrer=js13k)

### Mobile

The game was made mobile first. Hold finger down to inflate the bubble. Be careful though, if pressure exceeds 13, bubble burst! ðŸ«§ðŸ’¥
