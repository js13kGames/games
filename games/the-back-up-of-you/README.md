Fly a spaceship through a randomly generated level.
Use LEFT, RIGHT and UP ARROWS to steer.
You need to finish the level within given time.
Then interesting stuff starts happening under the hood - an AI is trained first on your data, then is improving further without human supervision. After a while (the airmiles are really just a progress meter) you will get a chance to race against the trained alogorithm. While you will be racing the improvements will be still ongoing, so each next race you start is going to be against an improved AI (the generation is indicated in the name of the bot player).
