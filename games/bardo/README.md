Bardo:

In Buddhism, Bardo is the state of existence between two lives on Earth.â€¨
In this state, one may experience terrifying hallucinations that arise from previous actions.
For prepared and appropriately trained individuals, Bardo offers a great opportunity for liberation.
While for others, it can be a place of great danger...
