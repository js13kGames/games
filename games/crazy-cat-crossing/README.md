You are a cat who stole a broken truck, and must get to the other side of the road while avoiding crashing, but wait, you can't stop 'driving'!

Controls: Left/right arrow keys or a/d to turn, and you go forward automatically (broken truck!!)
Gameplay: Try not to crash into cars or the top and bottom sides of the screen. Each time you go across the road, you gain a point!
