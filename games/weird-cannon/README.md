It's 13th century and a horde of enemies is charging at you. All you have to defend yourself is a weird cannon that you have bought at discount. It's pretty powerful and can hit several enemies at once, but it's damage area has a very weird shapes.

You lose once any enemy reaches the left side of the screen. To make a move, click on the shape in the bottom palette then on the battlefield in the top. You also can rearrange the shapes on the palette, so you have free space to recieve a bigger shapes.

Do you think this mechanics worth expanding on and making a full game out of it? Leave comments here or in discussions on git.
