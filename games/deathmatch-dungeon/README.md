Deathmatch Dungeon is a multiplayer game where mages battle it out in the classic deathmatch tradition in a pixel art style.

The aim is to kill as many opponents as you can in a three minute timed round whilst dying as few times as possible.

A new round will start as soon as there are at least two players in the dungeon. Anyone can join at any time. A winner will be declared after the three minutes is up.

Pick up scrolls to get a random, different magical ability. Collect potions to restore health.

Controls:
* WASD or arrow keys to move, mouse to aim and click to shoot

Features:
* Press the tab key for online chat

You will need someone to play against but you can explore the dungeon and discover the scrolls without.

Good luck and have fun!
