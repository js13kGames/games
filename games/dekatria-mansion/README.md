Count Dekatria's Mansion
Welcome to Count Dekatria's Mansion, a thrilling strategic board game where your characters must navigate rooms, solve puzzles, and avoid being expelled by Count Dekatria! The game is based on the concept of Triskaidekaphobiaâ€”the fear of the number 13. Can you outwit the Count before it's too late?

Gameplay Overview
In Count Dekatria's Mansion, you control a party of 5 characters. Each character has special abilities that will help you navigate the mansion and solve its puzzles. As you explore, you'll face challenges tied to the unlucky number 13. Your objective is to score points by matching characters with rooms and using their abilities to overcome obstacles.

However, beware! Every time a 13 is rolled, you get closer to being expelled from the mansion. If 13 is rolled 13 times, Count Dekatria will expel you, and the game will end!

How to Play
1. Selecting Your Party
You must select 5 characters from the Character Selection Area. Each character has a unique ability that can help you during the game. Once your party is selected, click the Start Game button to begin.
2. Moving Your Characters
Roll the dice to move your characters. Dice results range from 10 to 16, and each number corresponds to a specific room in the mansion. Drag and drop characters from the hallway into the room that matches the rolled number. Characters can only move to certain rooms based on the mansion's layout and broken walls.
3. Using Abilities
Characters have special abilities that can be activated when in the right room or situation. For example, Muscle Joe can break through walls, and Magnify Mark can reveal all hidden emojis in a room. Use abilities strategically to clear rooms and score points.
4. Matching Emojis
Each room contains hidden emojis that correspond to certain characters. If a character matches an emoji in a room, they score a point, and the emoji is revealed. The goal is to reveal 13 or more emojis in the mansion to open room 13 and slay Count Dekatria.
