Your new job is to capture souls floating on the River of The Dead. Capture them and you'll be rewarded.

Controls:
If using the paddle, click and drag to row the boat.
If using the grabber, click to take a ghost.
You can use the tool with left click and switch tools using right click or space bar.

Other info:
Capturing white ghosts gives you energy called "soul power".
Capturing colored ghosts gives you currency called "memories".
You can purchase upgrades using memories. Switch to the grabber to select and buy items at the store. But watch out, if you run out of soul power you'll lose all of your memories!
