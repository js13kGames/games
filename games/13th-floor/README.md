13th Floor is a stealth horror game requiring you to stay vigilant and stay in the shadows.

You receive a strange invitation to a party celebrating the 13th JS13k gaming competition. The party is on the 13th floor where there are 13 rooms, what could go wrong?

## Instructions

You arrive at the 13th floor with a **Key**. Go to the room number you have the key for. Inside that room, another key will be hidden. Find it and go to the next room and repeat until you find the key to Room 1313.

Use your **Flashlight** (<kbd>F</kbd>) to find the rooms and search for items.

Some rooms will start unlocked. They have **Health Packs** hidden in them. Use them to restore health.

When **It** arrives, don't let It see you. **You can see It coming by watching for It's light**.

_**If It sees you, run and hide.**_
