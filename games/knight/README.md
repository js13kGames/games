In the long span of 100 years, living in the 12th century, a turtle witnesses the contemporary knights braving thorns and obstacles. Playing the role of a turtle, we must guide the knights to a safe path, avoiding monster attacks, and ensure a peaceful journey throughout these 100 years.

Unlike RPGs, this is a rhythm game. Your path is determined by the score you achieve.

Press the crosshair in sync with the musical notes' beats to earn corresponding scores.

The musical notes have left and right distinctions.
