**During World War II, there was an Allied squadron of fighter planes in the Pacific known as the Black Cats.**

Their PBY Catalinas were painted black to blend into the night sky. Equipped with radar, capable of landing on the sea, and boasting long-range endurance, they are often considered the first stealth aircraft.

The Black Cats carried out a wide variety of missionsâ€”ranging from rescuing downed pilots at sea to sinking enemy vessels at night with torpedoes.

This game is a tribute to the courage and ingenuity of those pilots.

1..9 = Change views

M = Map

N = Radar

## Tutorial

There are three missions to accomplish:
- Rescue downed pilots (they float on a raft, they are hard to find)
- Sink Japanese transports (careful, they are equipped with AA Guns)
- Sink Japanese submarines

If you run out of fuel or ammo, fly back to the base and land near the tower, it will refill them automatically.

## Tips

Use the scope view (Key 7) to aim better your torpedos.
Careful with the fuel, if you run out you are lost.
To sink vessels, try to fly close to the sea, that way they cant shoot you, or wait until is dark.
Remember to check the map and the radar.

## Comments

I runned out of space too soon while making the game which meant I spent more time reducing the size than adding all the features I had in mind.
