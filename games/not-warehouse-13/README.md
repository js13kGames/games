You've just got hired to organise boxes in a warehouse.

These are no ordinary boxes... they merge when they collide and their labels change accordingly.
Nobody knows what's inside these boxes but when they're labelled with "13" they cannot be moved.
Luckily, "-13" boxes can nullify "13" boxes.

Your job is to ensure this warehouse is clear of "13" boxes.

"Not Warehouse 13" is a puzzle game in which you must swipe to merge boxes until you get rid of all the dreaded boxes labelled with 13.

Use the Arrow Keys or Swipe to move the boxes.
