Back Relax is a very simple gaze-based VR game for people with back pain.

You'll need to lie down, probably with a pillow, in order to test the game. (Alternatively, you can stare at the ceiling and crane your neck, but I don't recommend it.)

As a chronic back pain sufferer, I've often wished for simple games I could play while lying down; this year's theme resonated with that desire, so I made this. (I was on opioids for SEVEN YEARS before I learned they're not effective for chronic pain, and got off of them. Yay!)

Scientific studies have proven VR can help alleviate pain. "Pain was reduced from pre-session during the VR session by 60%." - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5172565/
