A puzzle game that combines Sokoban-like gameplay mechanics with match-3. 

You play as some kind of space creature controlling a flying saucer. Match three (or more) space goblins of the same color to destroy them. Collect every star in the room to complete the puzzle.

Controls:
Arrow keys to move, Backspace to undo a move, R to restart, Enter to pause

Compatibility:
Tested on Firefox and various Chromiums-based browsers (Opera & Edge) on Linux and Windows. The font in the "A game by" screen is a bit wrong on Chromium-based browsers on Windows, otherwise no major differences noticed. Works best on Chromium-based browsers (framerate is lower on Firefox)
