Your spaceship ran out of fuel.  You had to make an emergency landing on an unknown planet.  Obtain the nine energy crystals scattered around the world to get back to orbit.  Drill and build ladders throughout the world to help yourself get around.

Controls:
Z = Jump
X = Dash / Shoot
Move Left / Drill Left = Left Arrow
Move Right / Drill Right = Right Arrow
Build Ladder = Up Arrow
Drill Down = Down Arrow

Helpful Advice (take it or discover for yourself. =) ): 
- Mine iron to build ladders
- Mine ice to shoot ice balls at enemies.
- When moving up against the underside of a block while on a ladder, you can move to the left to dig a tile above and place a ladder.  Alternating between the left and right tile allows you to destroy tiles and build ladders at the same time.
- You can mine diagonally by holding the down arrow key and the left/right arrow key.  This allows you to mine multiple tiles at once.

Enjoy!
