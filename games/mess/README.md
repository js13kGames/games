Game based upon concept of popular sliding puzzles. You start with pieces ordered by background colour (hue), your goal is to rearrange them to fit with colors of borders. Use arrow keys or mouse / finger to move white piece.

Be careful! Every 10 (easy), 15 (medium) seconds permutation of your pieces will be reversed. In hard difficulty you will have to deal with inversion of your permutation every 30 seconds.

Math skills are not required, but might be very helpful :)
