Spare Me is a game about bowling, a fun way to learn math, a love letter to the world's second best solitaire card game. Built for an iPhone, it should run in most browsers. Save games are supported and high scores are sharable. There are Easter eggs when you win, tributes when you lose, and the difficulty is as hard as you make it. Have fun.
