Bellwoods is an art game for mobile and desktop. Navigate your kite (which has drifted ‘off its line’) through endless fields of color and sound, trying to discover new worlds.

The graphics and audio is entirely procedurally generated, and each new world is unique from the last.

Created by Matt DesLauriers with the contribution of Mélissa Hernandez.
