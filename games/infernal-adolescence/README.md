DEMONS ARE JUST LIKE US... UNTIL THEIR 13TH BIRTHDAY.
Help a struggling teenage demon go through puberty, transforming from a snot-nosed brat to the vile creature we all fear. 

The mechanics are all point-and-click buttons, and the mechanics are in the style of an incremental game. You can mute the audio, but I recommend turning it back on when you start learning the fiddle! 

Thanks for playing!
