What happens if the Internet scales across multiple planets and star systems? Can you help transmit packets across the galaxy?

The objective of the game is to transmit an Internet packet from the source planet to the destination planet and then back again to the source planet. The packets can hop onto other planets and get retransmitted from that planet. Both source and destination are marked green.
