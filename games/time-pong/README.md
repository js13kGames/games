In this game you don't control you character, but with a single mouse click, or tap on the screen, you can reverse the time.

Actually this is pretty much all you can do.

On each level, you will find obstacles with different shapes, and moving and rotating at different speeds.

Avoid the obstacles and make your character hit the goal. Try to make it in the smallest time possible!
