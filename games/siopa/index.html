You look up. A stranger has his back against the cabinet, preventing it from falling on you.<p>"I will protect you," the stranger tells you.<p>The man gives you a warm, inviting smile and extends his hand to you. You gape at the outstretched hand while your heart thunders in your chest.<p><e>All is still.<c goto=end>Continue</c></e></s><s id=outsideOfficeLife><p>The land ruptures and convulses as you stumble behind the bench. Coughing and gasping in the dusty air, you finally see the trees and duck behind them for protection. Something that sounds like an avalanche rends the air. Frantically, you look around and see that the nearby hill is rolling forward. You begin sprinting, but the crusty mound is faster than you. Soon, a shadow passes over your head. You trip and are sent sprawling on the asphalt. Looking back, you see the ground tower above you. You also notice a figure step between you and the oncoming landslide.<p>"Trust me," the stranger tells you as he notices the fear flood your eyes.<p>The man raises his arms. The land not only stops but retreats to where it came from originally. Your body tingles, but these new feelings do not arise from the earthquake. The man turns and looks directly into your eyes.<p><e>All is still.<c goto=end>Continue</c></e></s><script>"use strict";function Siopa(startID){var siopa=this;this.sBox=document.createElement("div"),this.sBox.id="sBox",document.body.appendChild(this.sBox),this.states={},this.currentScene=null,document.body.addEventListener("click",(function(event){var element=event.target;if(siopa.clearMenu(),"e"==element.tagName.toLowerCase()){for(var cs=element.getElementsByTagName("c"),menu=document.createElement("eMenu"),i=0;i<cs.length;i++){var c=cs[i];if(siopa.isActionActive(c)){var item=document.createElement("eMenuItem");item.c=c,item.innerHTML=c.innerHTML,menu.appendChild(item)}}document.body.appendChild(menu);var menuRect=menu.getBoundingClientRect();menu.style.left=Math.floor(event.clientX-.5*menuRect.width)+"px",menu.style.top=Math.floor(event.clientY)+"px",siopa.menu=menu}if("emenuitem"==element.tagName.toLowerCase()){var c=element.c,evalCode=c.getAttribute("eval");if(evalCode){var result=eval(evalCode);if(!1===result)return}for(var show=c.getAttribute("show"),texts=siopa.sBox.getElementsByTagName("t"),i=0;i<texts.length;i++)texts[i].style.display=texts[i].getAttribute("name")==show?"block":"none";var turnon=c.getAttribute("turnon");if(turnon)for(var ons=turnon.split(" "),i=0;i<ons.length;i++)siopa.states[ons[i]]=!0;var turnoff=c.getAttribute("turnoff");if(turnoff)for(var offs=turnoff.split(" "),i=0;i<offs.length;i++)siopa.states[offs[i]]=!1;siopa.updateEntityColors();var to=c.getAttribute("goto");to&&siopa.activateScene(to)}})),document.body.addEventListener("keydown",(function(e){27==e.keyCode&&siopa.clearMenu()})),this.activateScene(startID)}function load(){siopa=new Siopa("start")}function beginAir(e){var t="Death";e&&(t="Life"),siopa.activateScene("livingRoom"),setTimeout((function(){siopa.activateScene("porch"===siopa.currentScene?"outside"+t:"stormShelter"===siopa.currentScene?"shelter"+t:"inside"+t)}),6e4)}function beginWater(e){var t="Death";e&&(t="Life"),siopa.activateScene("onDeck"),setTimeout((function(){siopa.activateScene("onDeck"===siopa.currentScene?"onDeck"+t:"belowDeck"+t)}),6e4)}function beginFire(e){var t="Death";e&&(t="Life"),fireSave=e,siopa.activateScene("inTent"),fireTimer=setTimeout((function(){siopa.activateScene("driving"===siopa.currentScene?"jeep"+t:"smoke"+t)}),6e4)}function explodeJeep(){clearTimeout(fireTimer),siopa.activateScene(fireSave?"jeepLife":"jeepDeath")}function beginEarth(e){var t="Death";e&&(t="Life"),siopa.activateScene("inCubical"),setTimeout((function(){siopa.activateScene("inCubical"===siopa.currentScene||"hallway"===siopa.currentScene?"inOffice"+t:"outsideOffice"+t)}),6e4)}function complete(e){siopa.states[e+"Complete"]=!0,siopa.states.completedOne=!0,siopa.states.airComplete&&siopa.states.waterComplete&&siopa.states.fireComplete&&siopa.states.earthComplete?siopa.activateScene("selectionFinal"):(document.getElementById("prompt").innerHTML="Select another element:",siopa.activateScene("selection"))}var siopa,fireTimer,fireSave;Siopa.prototype.activateScene=function(e){var t=document.getElementById(e);this.sBox.innerHTML=t.innerHTML,this.currentScene=e,this.updateEntityColors(),this.clearMenu()},Siopa.prototype.isActionActive=function(e){var t=e.getAttribute("on");if(t&&!this.states[t])return!1;var i=e.getAttribute("off");return!i||!this.states[i]},Siopa.prototype.updateEntityColors=function(){for(var e=this.sBox.getElementsByTagName("e"),t=0;t<e.length;t++){for(var i=e[t],n=i.getElementsByTagName("c"),o=!1,a=0;a<n.length;a++){var s=n[a];if(this.isActionActive(s)){o=!0;break}}i.className=o?"":"inactive"}},Siopa.prototype.clearMenu=function(){if(this.menu){try{document.body.removeChild(this.menu)}catch(e){}this.menu=null}},window.addEventListener?window.addEventListener("load",load):window.attachEvent&&window.attachEvent("onload",load)</script>
