Link up the asteroids in a chain to clear them from the field by focusing on them with your gaze.
Pass through purple waypoints to add more power to your drone.
Find a yellow warp point to jump to another sector higher up. This will also clear all asteroids in your current chain.

There is no end goal, but you can run out of power, marking your droid offline.
