Solve the mystery of the XIII floor.
I bet you can do it in just 5 steps using only 3 buttons.

User guide:
You control the first elevator. The second elevator moves in sync, always maintaining the same floor distance.
The building is ancient: if the load difference matches the larger elevator's capacity, the heavier one drops a floor.

Elevator rules:
* If there are people on the floor, they enter the elevator up to its maximum capacity.
* If the floor is empty, everyone exits the elevator.
