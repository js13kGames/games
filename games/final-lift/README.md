You've awoken in a strange elevator that doesn't seem to indicate what floor it is on.  You know you've started on floor 1.  Each floor makes different demands of your mental facilities.  After you've completed the task, you must select an amount of floors to go up or down.  You'll need to keep track of your current floor yourself. 

Don't let the time run out, and whatever you do, make sure you stay away from floor 13!
