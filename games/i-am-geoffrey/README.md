A fast paced multi-player game, the objective is to get behind other players to stab them in the back.

You can only kill another player by approaching them from behind, so you'll need to outwit eachother.  Use bombs to keep them on their toes. Collect stars to boost your score.  Use green diamonds to reverse the direction of the entire game!

This game is best played with a group - there's not much point in playing on your own!
