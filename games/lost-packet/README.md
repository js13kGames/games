During a mundane transfert of data, the worst thing that can happen arrived : the connexion was lost !
You are now stuck in the network, trying to survive long enough for the connection to return. But the evil glitches will come to corrupt you !
You must protect your data at all cost : if the glitches gets to it, they will corrupt it. Be wary to not touch the glitches yourself, as they will corrupt you too ! use qsdz/asdw to move, the mouse to look and hold the mouse button or space to load your weapons. 

For the moment, only the survival mode is available, and due to a git error, I won't be able to finish the game before the 13, so this is my entry for the competition.

This version is the one of the last commit on git, with 2 files missing from the repo; I forgot to add them before commit and I don't have access to my good computer until the 15 (that's why I can't finish the game). I will add them as soon as I can, but if the repo isn't sync with the submission, it is normal.
