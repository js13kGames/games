Use WASD to move, Space for the sword (if you collected it) and Shift to switch to boomerang boomerang (once you collect it) and WASD to control it.

Hi, my name is Andrei, I am 11 years old and I started coding in python when I was 9 years old. Between then and now I learned Javascript, CSS, php, C# and C. But I mostly use Javascript for the great Canvas API for video games. The game was made using VSCode, and the graphics was made in PixilArt.com. 
  I made my own file format for sprites, optimized to be as small as possible (32 characters/sprite), it is just a string with binary data. For sounds and music I used the good old audioContext with oscillators with predefined frequnecies and the footsteps were made with a sawtooth oscilator with frequency set to 1 (played in a loop). I enjoyed this jam, I will probably be back next year.
