For centuries the village of Glothad has sent its people to the arena for their coming of age. While not as deadly as fighting a wild saberclaw in the high mountains of Chodun, goblins will take no qualm with attacking a human. 

Three heroes must battle five goblins to survive and succeed in this arena. Do you have the iron fortitude to do battle?

**How to play**
As the player you control the 3 purple colored pieces (Heroes) on the board.
The computer will play the green pieces (Goblins) on the board.
Click on one of the heroes to see blue squares showing where you can move, the red squares is the attack range.
Clicking on a blue square with a hero selected will move them.
Clicking on a red square with a goblin will attack.
A hero can move and attack, but cannot attack then move.
After each hero has completed their action click on the 'End Round' button.
Repeat till victory or defeat!

Good luck!
