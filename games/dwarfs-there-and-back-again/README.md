Dwarfs: There and Back Again is a tale of high adventure, undertaken by a company of dwarfs, in search of dragon-guarded gold, true friendship, and varieties of ale (not necessarily in that order).

If you could go back in time, would you change things for the better? Would you resist temptation that drives your life choices? Do we create our own destiny? Those are all questions.

The game is heavily inspired by other games. (Aren't we all.)
