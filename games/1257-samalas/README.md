In the wake of the cataclysmic eruption of 1257 in Lombok you find yourself standing amidst the fiery chaos and smouldering ashes. As a time traveler, you face not just the relentless force of nature, but an enigmatic and malevolent AI that awoke in the volcano, seeking to plunge the world into a chilling 700-year ice age. Your only allies in this desperate quest are the mystical Banyan trees, ancient guardians of balance. Harness their sacred power, challenge the wrath of the volcano, and thwart the plans of the AI, Abyssus. The fate of epochs rests in your hands.
