Ahoy Corsair! Welcome to __The Isle-Hop Odyssey__, where you are stranded on an island with little more than your two legs and a soon-to-be-rusty ship nearby. Hop from island to island like a seafaring kangaroo - or maybe more like a seagull after a cake - conquering forts, battling crabs, and other scallywags as you sail through treacherous seas filled with giant squids and sea serpents just waiting to ruin your day.

Your mission? Siege castles, recruit a ragtag crew (who might not know port from starboard), and loot dungeons, all while trying not to sink your ship or get pinched by a particularly grumpy crab. But don't get too cozy! There is a mysterious island no one talks about - except when they’re screaming in terror. __The Cursed Isle__ (it's the 13th one), hides the nastiest dungeon of them all, home to a certain __Balrog__ (or was it Balron?) who's been feeling a bit cranky lately and definitely doesn’t like visitors. So, buckle up, sailor! Your Odyssey awaits - if you don’t get eaten by a squid first!

__Controls:__
Mobile controls are available in the bottom left of the screen. You can also move with gestures. For keyboard controls, use the arrow keys, WASD, and Spacebar.

__Gameplay:__
You have three main characters: the Hero, the Crew, and the Ship. Combat depends on your location: when sailing, you'll fight with the Ship; when on land, you'll battle with the Hero and Crew.

Your adventure kicks off on an island with a castle where you can upgrade your Ship. Scattered across the map are other islands, some with enemy-occupied forts and others with dungeons.

Your first task? Conquer these forts and build up your strength. But don't get too comfortable! Your ultimate mission is to defeat the Balrog, a fearsome foe lurking in the deepest level of the dungeon on the 13th Cursed Island. And remember, you have just 13 days to accomplish this, so set sail and get cracking!

The game has an installable <a href="https://www.foumartgames.com/games/Odyssey/">__Progressive Web App__</a> version. Enjoy!
