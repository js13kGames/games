It's the classic Worms mayhem, where two teams of worms – packing a formidable arsenal of bazookas, miniguns, cluster bombs, and more – fight it out to be the last one standing.

Playable as either local multiplayer, or remote multiplayer for up to 2 players at once.

With an (admittedly) very loose connection to the theme, "Worms 13k (and the Unholy Black Cat)" brings the familiar turn-based, terrain destruction gameplay, with the addition of two new cat-based weapons: The Nyan Cats and the Unholy Black Cat.

Use them at your leisure, but beware, friendships might not survive!
