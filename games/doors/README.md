Use the mouse/touch to drag your character around and dodge the enemies. Draw the spells as shown on the hud from the black end to the coloured end to fire back. If you're finding that difficult, click on the spells to show an outline so you can trace the spell. Enter a door to begin; perhaps they will lead somewhere strange.
