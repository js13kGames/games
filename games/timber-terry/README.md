Help Timber Terry as a bear chases him up a tree. Guide him to safety while saving any innocent bird nests hidden at the end of the branches. Your bird friend, Jimmy, will aid you in finding bird nests... but not all of them. Make sure to chop down the tree at the end and rid the forest of that scary bear.
