Giant monsters are roaming through the world, threatening your town and family.
In this typing game, you're defending your city against a giant monster by typing the displayed story.

Select a level by pressing 1, 2 or 3.
From now on type the highlighted words. Include spaces, full stops, exclamation marks and question marks.
Finish the texts before the monster reaches your base!

On the success and failure screen, press space to return to the main menu. Pressing H on the failure screen will give you insights in how close you got to the goal (spoiler alert).

The extras for monetized subscribers are a mode where the texts of the story got shuffled and the option to defend Berlin.
