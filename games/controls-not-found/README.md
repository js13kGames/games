The control panel of the ship is busted so up and down get swapped to different keys on the keyboard randomly.

Go through the tunnel and don't touch the sides or the rocks.

Keys: Initially use W and S for up and down. As the game progresses, it will change the keys for up and down. See the bottom left for new keys.
