# 🐾 Roni and Kira  

![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jorger/js13k-2025/refs/heads/main/demo.gif)  

🎯 Help **Kira** collect all the coins across **40 challenging levels**, with the support of her friend **Roni**.  

But beware! The path is full of tricky obstacles:  

- 🧱 **Walls**: Block the cats’ movement.  
- ⚔️ **Spikes**: Destroy careless cats (unless you grab the last coin first!).  
- 🔑🚪 **Keys & Doors**: Only **Roni** can pick up keys to open doors for Kira.  
- 📦 **Boxes**: Can’t be pushed, if you run with too much impulse, you’ll smash them! Be careful, spikes may be hidden underneath.  

🎮 **How to play:**  
Control the cats using **swipe gestures**, available on both **desktop** and **mobile**.  

🐱 Two cats, 40 levels, endless fun.  
Will you help **Roni and Kira** collect them all?
