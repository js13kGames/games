- There are code units with their respective programming language protocol in the server space.
- Player has to connect the units of same programming language and make a loop to confirm backup of that collection of data. Example: you connect all the 'C#' units with other 'C#' units and then connect the last with the first unit and then this collection will be backup and cleared from server space. 
- Player have initial 60 seconds for performing backup and as player score time also increase and hence player can score as high he/she can within the available time.
- If time run out to ZERO, then GAME will be OVER.
