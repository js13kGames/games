So, I'm a beginner dev, I don't have a lot of experience but with this competition I learned a lot and new things. But work and some assignments and college assessments took up my time. I couldn't complete the challenge. Is incomplete because it still needs to implement pathfinder in the invaders and implement the functionality of the objects.
