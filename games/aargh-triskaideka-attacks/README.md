13 days ago, a fleet of aliens - the **Trisdaideka** - started an invasion of earth. As everyone else on the planet is paralyzed by the resulting **Triskaidekaphobia**, it's up to you and your experimental rocket to defend the planet!

**This game is controlled by keyboard or gamepad, not the mouse!**
(details, see below)

## Story-Mode

Read the messages to unveil, what the game is about ;-)

## Horde-Mode

You want to start into the full action? You can "pause" the storymode (using the button at the bottom) and jump to a endless level, including a displayed score.
You can return to the story (where you left it) anytime

## Controls

### Gamepad

a **standard gamepad** is supported, the left analog  stick has a different gameplay-feeling than the arrow-buttons. The arrow-buttons have the same feeling as the keyboard.

**Using the analog stick:**
- the heading of your rocket is controlled by the stick-direction.
- accelerate using the right trigger-button (index finger)

**Using the arrow buttons:**
- the rocket is rotated by <kbd>&larr;</kbd> and <kbd>&rarr;</kbd> 
- the rocket is accelerated by  <kbd>&uarr;</kbd> or the right trigger

In both cases the <kbd>A</kbd> button fires your lasers

### Keyboard

- the rocket is rotated by <kbd>&larr;</kbd> and <kbd>&rarr;</kbd>  or <kbd>A</kbd> and <kbd>D</kbd>
- the rocket is accelerated by  <kbd>&uarr;</kbd> or <kbd>W</kbd>
- the lasers are fired by <kbd>SPACE</kbd>, <kbd>CTRL</kbd> or <kbd>ENTER</kbd>
