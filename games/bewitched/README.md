The 12th Century was a time of happiness for witches of the world..

...until, an evil demon turned The Five Great Witches into cats and imprisoned them in cursed towers.

Can you, a lowly apprentice, rescue them?


### Controls
- **Desktop**: Hold left arrow to fly left and right arrow to fly right 
- **Mobile**: Hold left to fly left and hold right to fly right

### How to play
Rescue the cat at the top of the tower and escape back through the entrance.

### Notes
For mobile, works best on iOS and Firefox Android, too.
I realised at the last moment that mobile Chrome had performance issues drawing circles to the canvas and had to tweak the mobile Chrome version. It is playable, though.

Hope you have as much fun playing as I did hacking this together. Enjoy!
