Row row row your boat,
quickly back up stream,
frantically frantically,
frantically frantically,
Life will end downstream...
____________________________

ROW is an infinite scroller.

While enjoying a leisurely day on the river, you come to the unfortunate realization that a log jam is blocking your path downstream. See how far back upstream you can get!

Avoid rocks and trees, and be sure to pick up the orange buoys for extra lives.

This game is designed for touch controls, but there are keyboard inputs as well. The tutorial shows the relevant left & right oar controls for both touch and keyboard.

Coil subscribers! Enjoy more frequent life buoys and a slower difficulty ramp-up.
