Guide a mischievous black cat with a laser pointer and spread "bad luck" by crossing people’s paths. Survive the night, watch the mayhem (hello, flying Black Volga), and make the most of your nine lives. Built in raw WebGL under 13 KB - mentee-powered, mentor-polished!

## How to play (aka how do you make the cat follow your orders?)

Nice try. Use the laser pointer’s red dot on the floor. It’s a cat - it won’t listen to you anyway.

## What’s the objective?

It’s a light "horror/survival" game. Stay alive as long as you can and bring bad luck to as many unsuspecting souls as possible.

## Hints

- To bring "bad luck" to someone, just cross their path - they'll turn yellow. Our 13 KB budget is tight, so the only "accident" we implemented is a cameo from an urban legend: the Black Volga. You’ve got a whole crew on call; they work fast and efficiently. It’s 2025, so yes, they fly - no need to run you over.

- It gets darker over time, but don’t worry—our cat’s eyes glow in the dark.

- Wait for "rush hour." It gets wonderfully chaotic when everyone goes outside.

- Nine lives aren’t forever. Spend them wisely—and have fun! :D

## About

This project was a blast. Most of the heavy lifting was done by Julia—my mentee, whom I’ve coached over the last year. I added the final touches and squeezed it under 13 KB for JS13K.

A month ago neither of us knew raw WebGL. Not much has changed—except we now have a working game ;)

PS: Julia asked me to include this quote:
“My mentor, Bartosz Cytrowski, is truly the best—always inspiring and supportive. I wholeheartedly recommend him to anyone who wants to grow.”

My two cents: Don’t joke with your mentees about “maybe building a 3D game for JS13K” if you can’t say no to a challenge :P

PS2: The flying Volga started as a bug - but with the right framing, every bug can become a funny feature :P
