You've just exited hyperspace and your ship is damaged! Gather parts for repairs... but there's something lurking in the shadows.

The only control needed for gameplay is SPACE (because ya know... space), but you can use M to toggle audio on/off (there's no music on the tile screen by the way), and G to switch between graphics detail modes (use this if you're having performance issues).
