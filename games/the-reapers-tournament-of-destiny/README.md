About the game
----------------

This 2D fighting game is based on fighting game fundamentals known as footsies or neutral game. Due to the size limit, the game's scope is minimal: you only have one attack and a parry. The goal is to keep your opponent at bay and to avoid getting hit. The game is played in rounds, and the first player to win two rounds wins the match.

Will you bait your opponent's attack and parry it? Or will you try to get in close and land a hit? The choice is yours!

How to play
------------

The game only has local multiplayer. You can play with a friend on the same computer or with a friend on another computer using Parsec or a similar service.
