On the moon of planet Figadore the Regolith starships have returned, but they are using advanced cloaking techniques to remain invisible. You must discover the hiding place of the last 3 remaining starships by firing splat missiles.

Green splat indicates a miss and pink splat indicates a hit. You have 24 missiles, but hits don't count. Once each ship is fully covered in splat, one of the finder indicators changes to black.

Try to find all three starships (2, 3 and 4 grid squares in length) in the least misses possible.

Optimised for mobile in portrait. At the start you have the choice of using a Protocol Labs decentralized distributed randomness beacon as the seed.
