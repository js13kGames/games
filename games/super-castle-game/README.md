This is a game about building a castle. Magnificent and sempiternal, the fortress of the mind will rise â€” and it begins with a single block.

Set in the 13th century, Super Castle Game immerses you in a captivating medieval fantasy world of some description.

### How to play

- Arrow keys or WASD (and R to restart the level)
- Tap on the screen
- Gamepad left analog stick (and B to restart the level)

The icons are: toggle audio, restart the level, and level select.

For best experience on Android, use the 'Add to Home screen' feature. Seriously, it's amazing how much better the game runs if started from that shortcut.

Thank you for playing!


### Decentralized

Super Castle Game allows you to make your own levels: see the [**Community Levels page**](//github.com/mvasilkov/super2023/tree/master/levels#super-castle-game-community-levels)

Levels are just links to an instance of the game, so they can be shared freely on any social network, git repository, by email, and so on. This is the real, useful decentralized functionality.

The game is hosted on IPFS:
