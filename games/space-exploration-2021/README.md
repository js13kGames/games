Explore the space by traveling from planet to planet. Just click (or tap) or press the spacebar in the right moment to leave the orbit for another planet.

Different types of planets will add challenges to your exploration or help you in being more successful.

The more successful you are, the more coins you get; these coins will unlock different spacecrafts for your next explorations. WebMonetization users get (almost) exclusive access to an additional spacecraft.

Fullscreen and music can be toggled by clicking/tapping the icons, or by pressing "f" or "m".

The music is based on extracts of Gustav Holst’s “The Planets”.
