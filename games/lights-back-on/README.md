There is a blackout!
You decide to go alone in the dark and look for the fuse box, but this is not an easy job.
Try to memorize the level before the power outage and be careful with the platforms and traps that you will face on your way.
Don't worry! you always have your lantern ready to help you, but remember that you can only use it once!

Controls:
Use arrows to move
Press Space to jump
Press R to restart level
Press F to use the lantern (only one use per level)
