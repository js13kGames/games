You found yourself in the empty room. You barely remember anything. And can't exit through the only door. There is a bed here, maybe if you sleep there you will recall something?

Controls - LMB to pick/place items and switch characters, RMB to use items and doors, middle button and the wheel to control the camera.

I wanted to try and fit the Fallout Shelter-like in the 13k for a while, so, here is it. 

The main difference - instead of leaving the Shleter to search for items and people outside, people here temporarily turn one (or several) of the room into the dreamscape (RMB on the bed!), where they automatically fight, loot and find new allies.

Skill training is also unusual. Each person or object in the game has a set of "Aspects". Characters wander around the room, from item to item, and slowly learn the Aspects from them. Learning speed depends on the character's level, which can only be raised by fighting (i.e. dreaming). So, you should mix and match sleeping and staying awake among the items with the Aspects you want.

Bed - the most important thing, RMB to sleep on it. It's aspect and level affects the apstcs and levels of the dream's "contents". The sleeper level and aspects matter too.

Doors - use (RMB) the black door with the high level enough character, and it will unlock the new room.

Worn and held items - affect the effective Aspects. Armor is worn by RMB.

Clock - place it on the top of the bed to automate sleeping.

Shrinker/Magnifier - use (RMB) them on items to change their size. Cosmetics only.
Brush - same, but to change the color.

Hammer - destroy item to instantly get a lot of it's Aspect.

Extractor - extract one of the Aspects as the Items as Essense. Works best if the Extractor and user have that Aspect.

Essense - RMB on the item to add it's Aspect.

Book - hold to slowly write in it.

Check the git page for updates, and, please, make me know if you want to see them. Most lacking thing in the moment is the balance, probably.
