Move left and right to try and keep from falling through gaps in the lines as they scroll up the screen.

This is a combination puzzle/quick reflex game which challenges you to try and remember the correct path through each level. It starts easy enough with just three lines but builds difficulty by increasing the number of lines and adding items which alter the ball position and the course itself. Fourteen levels slowly introduce game elements then crank up the difficulty. You can press "P" to see a preview and you can also pause the game three times each level by pressing the spacebar.

On touch-enabled devices, the screen is divided into thirds. Tapping the left side moves the ball left, tapping right moves right, and tapping in the middle is the same as pressing the spacebar (play/pause).
