A choose your own adventure game.

You're an amnesiac robot with corrupted mission data. Fly around, talk to the town's people to fill in the blanks, and then carry out your mission.

                    CONTROLS: 
DESKTOP: Arrows or awsd, space, y, n, +/- speed.

MOBILE: Landscape, tap to move, button to interact. Hint: tap past where you want to go.

COIL BONUS: Access to the level editor.

To use level editor: Press 'enter' before flying into building, 'enter' to exit. Refresh to reset.

**Note: npcs can be moved by hitting up arrow after clicking tile you want them to go to, but there are only 5 npc sprites, so make sure you erase before you drop, otherwise you'll create ghost effects.**
