It is autumn and the weather is rubbish.  The leaves need sweeping and you are not getting any younger.  Why do the caterpillars have it in for you?  Who knows?  Sweep up the leaves as they fall and don't let the leafometer reach full or the world will collapse under the weight of all the leaves.  Shooting stars which yield magic powers when picked up will fall periodically but be quick to pick them up as they soon disappear.
