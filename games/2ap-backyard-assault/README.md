It's a tiny XCOM-like.

I had two days left until deadline and was still high on adrenaline. So I decided to at least start something I was dreamed about for a long time: a tactical game that plays by XCOM rules. I.e. with 2 action points (hence the name), high/low cover system and the like.

By sheer luck, or maybe because mechanics I was implementing was very familiar to me, I did not hit any serious complications along the way. So, a hour before deadline I have a playable level (starring aforementioned Backyard, as a courtesy to js13k theme) with three distinct unit types and pretty shrewd AI.

Controls: Left click to select unit, move or fire, right click to deselect. Your side is blue. Rest is in in-game help.
