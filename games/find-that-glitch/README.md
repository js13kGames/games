Move with WSAD. Go up with Space. Go down with C. Look around with mouse. Click on screen to lock pointer.

The game has three stages:
1. Dig. Tunnel through walls, floors and ceilings to create level. Changes from all the players will be merged together before the next stage.
2. Hide. Move your player into secluded location. Your glitch will be placed at your location when the timer runs out.
3. Seek. Find the glitches placed by other players. Player with most glitches found wins.

Each round is time limited - hurry up!
If you join in the middle of the game, you will have to wait for the next stage.

Requires recent version of Chrome/Firefox with WebGL support.
