In Radial, players have to move their (frail) character around the circle to avoid the falling elemental blocks.

On desktop, use the right and left arrow keys to move around the center circle. On mobile, tap and hold the left and right sides of the screen to move around the circle.

The longer you survive, the larger your score is!
