## Platformer: Meoq n Shadow

Join the ultimate feline adventure in “Cats vs. Rat: Poop Quest!” Two brave cats set out on a daring mission to rescue the kidnapped princess from the clutches of the evil Rat King. Armed with sharp claws, fierce meows, and a rather… unusual secret weapon — their mighty poops — our fluffy heroes battle through tricky traps, sneaky minions, and cheesy fortresses.

Team up with a friend or go solo to unleash combos of paw swipes, tail whips, and tactical litter bombs. Collect power-ups, unlock hilarious abilities, and prove that no rat is too evil when two cats fight together!

Will you save the princess, or will the Rat King’s stink cheese win the day?
