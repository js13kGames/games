Important: This games requires one tracked controller to be played (tested on HTC Vive, should work on Oculus and perhaps DayDream)
Also don't forget to turn on sound for the best experience :)


Game Description:
------------------------------------------------
You lost your precious energy stones in a shifted dimension.

Use your magic light controller to make them visible and pull them closer to you.

Collect your lost stones by touching. Each stone you find and catch will refill your energy bar.

But be careful: Although you need your magic controller to see and pull your stones, it will drain energy when used.
