Roam around the city connecting to WiFi hotspots and completing the download and upload goals.

The closer you are to the centre of the network, the faster upload and download speeds will be.

Very much a prototype. Refer to bottom-left for actual coordinates. I never got to fully test the game so it might be unbeatable, it might be too easy. I don't even know. I made way too many compromises to meet the deadline. (Screw exams)

Controls:
← / a: rotate the player leftward
→ / d: rotate the player rightward
↑ / w: move forward
↓ / s: move backward
n: list available networks
p: pause the game
arrow keys: choose a network
enter: connect to a network

I wouldn't even have submitted a game had it not been for the encouraging words of @herebefrogs, @xem, @end3r, @kamyl, @udxs and @the_coder among others on the js13k slack team.
