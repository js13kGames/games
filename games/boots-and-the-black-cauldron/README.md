Boots the Cat is one evil animal. She always has been, always will be. But now she is worse than ever. Boots the Cat has figured out that she can use the witches Black Cauldrons for her own benefit...

On each level, Boots has to collect ingredients and then get into the Witch Hut. Once in the hut, Boots must get the Key for the next Hut, optionally dump ingredients in the Cauldron with Space or South Button, then run out of the door. 

Avoid Priests at all costs!

Each level has two distinct phases: Action and Step by Step.

Action

Run through the woods and gather mushrooms (be careful, you can only carry 1 to start, and then it goes up) while you avoid Priests that are hunting for you. Once you have gathered your mushrooms, then find the Hut and go inside.

Step by Step

You are now inside the Witch Hut! You should really unload your ingredients into the Cauldron, but you don't have to; you won't lose them but you won't get points yet either! You must get the Key however. Once you've collected the key, book it out the door before the Witch gets home!

Use WASD, arrows, or gamepad. Press Space, gamepad button, or click to begin/restart. Space and South gamepad button are for dropping or using ingredients.
