You are on a space mission and you have landed on the moon. You've been exploring the moon with your moon buggy, but you're running out of oxygen!
Drive the moon buggy back to the lunar lander before you run out of oxygen, while avoiding the rocks and collecting the stars. Will you make it
back to the lunar lander in time?

Controls:
Control the moon buggy with the arrow keys (Up accelerates, Down decelerates, Left and Right turns). Shoot stars with the space key.
