A Simple Simon inspired code sequence memory game.

- At each level of the game you will be presented with 4 coloured code discs
- Each disc will pulse and glow in a coded sequence
- When the 'ENTER CODE SEQUENCE' message displays, click on the coloured discs in the same order as the coded sequence
- If your entry matches the coded sequence, the sequence will display again with an additional sequence step
- Continue entering the code sequence until the full sequence is entered and you level up
If you enter the sequence incorrectly at any time you will be locked out and have to start the level again

Good Luck!
