"Forgotten Depths: Path of the Necromancer" is a simplified roguelite, deck building game where you will craft cards, and customized your deck to take on the undead and their masters.

Coil supporters will get an optional head start by having a few extra cards added to their card collection right from the start.

The game is playable on Desktop using keyboard (arrow keys + x and c) or a controller, and it is also playable on mobile via an onscreen DPAD and buttons.

TIP: If you have trouble progressing through harder levels, consider re-clearing a previous level to get more materials for crafting, a few cards can make a big difference.
