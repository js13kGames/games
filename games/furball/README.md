# FURBALL 🐱💨

**FURBALL** is a minimalist arcade platformer where you guide a little cat leaping across floating diamond platforms in the sky.  
Time your jumps carefully, keep your balance, and climb as high as you can to rack up points.  
But be careful — miss a platform and you’ll pay the price!

## 🎮 How to Play

- **Click / Tap** anywhere on the screen to make the cat jump.  
- The jump’s **horizontal direction and strength** depend on where you tap:
  - Tap on the **left side** → jump left.
  - Tap on the **right side** → jump right.
  - Tap closer to the middle → smaller sideways movement.
  - *A very faint vertical line appears in the middle to help you orient your taps.*
- Land on new platforms to **score points**.  
- Falling costs you **-5 points** (ouch!).

## ⚙️ Extra Features
- Difficulty slider: adjust the platform scroll speed (1 = easy, 10 = hard).  
- Procedurally generated platforms for endless play.  
- Simple retro-inspired visuals and sound.
