The objective is to complete the mazes in the fastest possible time. Be warned that if you hit a glitch the maze will re-generate. Use arrow keys or tap/click on the maze to move the player around.

One of my aims was to see how far in September 2016 browsers support ES6 with out any polyfills or transpilation. 

This entry uses non transpiled ES6, CSS3 animations and flexbox so will only work and has been tested on the latest Chorme desktop, chrome mobile (Andriod)  Firefox and Edge browsers. Sorry IE and Safari you are too far behind.
