The main idea of the game begins with a pun about this year's theme: "Offline" becomes "Deactivated Lines".

Put yourself in the shoes of a funny meme who wants to become famous on the Internet. Avoid the evil "haunters" who try to eliminate you from the network. 
Keep your power as high as possible collecting the magical energy of the Internet and get as many points as possible before they catch you or the lines becomes off. All of this with a cool retro essence.
