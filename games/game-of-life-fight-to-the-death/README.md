Game Of Life: Fight To The Death is yet another view on the classic John Conway's game/model. The main added feature is that you have two tribes of the living cells. These two tribes will fight each other to the death after you set a battle field. Well, actually not necessarily to the death, :-) because you can limit number of generation to pass.
