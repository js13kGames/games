On August 7th, 1974, a young Frenchman named Philippe Petit stepped out on a wire illegally rigged between the New York World Trade Centerâ€™s twin towers.

(only tested on Android phone + JS13k'17 Cardboard)

I'm french, it's 9/11, the theme is about being offline, so I made this little third-person VR game in less than 10 hours as a bonus fot this great game jam :)

You have 1 minute to cross the gap between the Twin Towers. Tilt your head on the left or on the right to stay balanced.

PS: I included Babylon.js to respect the rules, but the game is done entirely with vanilla HTML + JS + CSS3D!
