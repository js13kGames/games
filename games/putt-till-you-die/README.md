Putt Till You Die is a 2 dimensional bird's eye view mini-putt golf game written in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

The game its self doesn't really fit in with the theme but hey, you could literally die whilst playing the game.. as you could any other game ;)

Also during the production of this game, my dear friend *Ewook* passed away after a short battle with cancer. He loved golf and up until a month before his passing was playing 4 rounds a week. He was 84 and this game is dedicated to him.

The aim of Putt Till You Die is to basically putt the ball into the goal. That's pretty much it.

Controls:
- Hold and move the left mouse button to aim, a longer line means more putt power.
- Press space key to cancel aiming.
- Release the left mouse button to make your putt.
- Hold the shift key to show your statistics.
- Press the TILDE key to show the instructions.
- Press the BACKSPACE key to access the reset menu.

Putt Till You Die is best enjoyed in fullscreen and with some chillout music playing in the background.

Note that when you close the Putt Till You Die application, the game state will be persisted to the browsers local storage, so the next time you start Putt Till You Die, the game will continue exactly in the same state.
