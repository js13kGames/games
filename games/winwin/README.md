In WinWin you control a spaceship and fight alien invaders. Each time you destroy an enemy you restore a deleted file from the hard drive. Some files from the game itself are missing too, so you have to search throughout the 12 stages to find the missing data. When you do so, new spaceships will be unlocked, giving you the opportunity to try new weapons.

Controls: [Arrow Keys] [A] [D] Movement; [Space] Shoot; [C] Toggle shooting
Shortcuts: [R] Reset game, [F] Fullscreen, [P][Esc] Pause

Inspired by Lose/Lose by Zach Gage - a game that randomly deletes files from your machine on every killed invader.
