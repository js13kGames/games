Shoot'em UP with Arkanoid mechanics, i.e. instead of dodging bullets, you try to deflect them with your body back at enemy.

Also game has elements of Snake (because that's what you are in it) and SuperHot(there is an optional mode that works like that).

Controls: just move the mouse. Also, ESC takes you back to menu, and Right Click toggles Superhot mode.
