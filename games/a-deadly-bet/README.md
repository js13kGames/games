You **died** !
But that won't do it for you, so you bargain with Death to live a little more.

Death invite you to play a deadly game where **13 will become your worst nightmare**.

Win and live, loose and you'll regret it.

## Information

The game plays with the mouse or by touch.
Instructions will be displayed on the first run.
For better readability, play the game in landscape.

## Credits

Thanks to all of the Creeps au sucre for testing and suggestions.
And a very special thanks to my partner who let me finalize the game while taking care of our new born baby girl.
