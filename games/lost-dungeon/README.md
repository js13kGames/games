Uh oh, lost in yet another dungeon! Rumor has it that on the 13th level there is an exit, although it may not be unguarded. 

With this game, I wanted to recapture the feeling I had when playing old-school RPGs with no built-in map. 

You'll want to collect as many attack (†) and defense (♥) dice as possible. Stronger die have levels (1, 2, 3, etc...), so you will need to pick up resource (●) dice in your tile to use them. Click on a die to pick it up, click on it in your inventory to throw it. Look down (down key, or swipe up) to throw a die into your current tile (good for defense) look up to throw a die forward (good for attacking). Moving and throwing dice take a turn, everything else is free. If all else fails, run away!
