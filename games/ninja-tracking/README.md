Point a phone to your webcam and kill all ninjas, watch out for bombs. This game uses tracking.js to track colors.
How to play

- It'll ask permission to use your webcam, allow it
- Get your phone and open http://trackingjs.com/marker/magenta.html in a browser

It also works on Firefox Nightly, you need to enable getUserMedia by setting media.navigator.enabled to true in about:config.
It works offline and there's no external dependency.
