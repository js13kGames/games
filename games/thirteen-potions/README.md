You are a knight who has to collect the 13 potions in the castle as fast as possible. But be careful, there's 13 ghosts who want to slow you down!

Use your arrow keys to navigate around the map as fast as you can! My record is 52 seconds ;)

This game is disqualified because I mistakenly didn't think that the Phaser framework would count towards the final size (my bad), but it was really fun making my first game for this!
