A driving game reversed: your car is actually the worst on the road! Use arrow keys to drive and try to not get hit by other traffic. Get as far as you can before your car breaks down.

The game is just a single 6kb html file with no images used. This is the first game that I've finished so I'm proud though it's not as finished as it could be.
