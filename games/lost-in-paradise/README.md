This is my very first game I've ever programmed. I didn't program it myself. I got help with the programming of Robert RÃ¼diger. Thanks for that.
And my friend Claudia Duwe helped me with the design and ideas. Thank you very much. 
The idea was actually that a chicken with a ship stranded. And lost his memory. Unfortunately, during the course of programming everything turned out differently. Now I have landed on a simple jump and run and I'm very proud on it.
Have fun while playing.
