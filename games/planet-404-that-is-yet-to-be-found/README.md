In this tiny game you control a space craft and explore the galaxy. The game has three types of planets. Play several times to find planets of each type.
Unfortunately, I didn't have enough time to implement positioning planets and empty places on the map and saving already explored places. Because of that the planet type is chosen randomly every time you press the Go! button on the map.
