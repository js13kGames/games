This game is about a character who wants to escape from the 13th floor using the stairs, avoiding some giant moths.

## Idea

The idea was inspired from true events, I lived with my wife and kids on a 13th floor, and there was a time when both elevators were not working, so my wife had to use the stairs, also she doesn't like moths.

## Objective

The objective is to get to the ground floor, avoiding the moths. If you are hit by a moth you lose one life.

## Controls

To play you can use on-screen buttons or keyboard up - down arrows.

## Tech stack
Plain js, html and css. I'm using a 2D canvas library I've been writing for a couple of years.  Code is minified using terser.

 Tip: there are no moths at the edges of the stairs.

## Thanks to
My wife and kids who helped me with ideas and beta testing.
