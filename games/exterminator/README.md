The **Exterminator** scans for the number 13 hidden within the patterns of your **room** so you can eliminate them. Like in the Ghostbusters movie. Hurry or they will overload the circuits.

- Controls: click/tap
- Tested on: Android (Chrome/Firefox) in portrait mode.

Note:
- This device uses the camera so make sure it has **permission** for your browser.
- Make sure the **lights** are on and that you have camera/video enabled in apps/chrome and chrome/settings.
- After you click **Scan**, you should get some **detections**. If not, then move your phone back and forth. When you get some detections, you can click the scope to **Capture** them. Once captured, you must quickly **smash** them because they are not happy and will begin to zip around faster and faster until they **overload** your circuits.
- Tip: If you point it at the ceiling, you will capture less 13s.
- Warning: Consumer protection groups have found that this device doesn't actually work to eliminate the number 13 from your environment. But if it makes you feel better, that is all that matters 🐲
