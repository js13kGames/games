In Refuel the Factory you control the blue spaceship using the arrow keys and you have to collect the green orbs and return them to the factory.

Beware of the asteroids that constantly come raining down, because if they hit you it's game over and you have to restart the level.

If you reach the score of 20 you win the game.

Your ship has limited space in its cargo, and it can only carry two green orbs at a time, and you have to decide if you want to return with one green orb (only 1 point to your score) or try and return with two to the factory (2 points added to your score).
