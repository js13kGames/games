Endless 2D Space Survival shooter.

WASD / Arrows keys to thrust
Mouse to aim / steer
M to mute

Fly around an endless, procedurally generated Universe. Each star system contains a unique enemy with a procedurally generated Space ship.

After killing all enemies in a star system you can upgrade your Ship by assimilating the enemies' ship components.

Due to a typo and some logic that depended on property-names, part of the game broke during the minification process. Everything runs fine up until you kill all enemies in a star system. So you unfortunately won't be able to upgrade your ship and travel to further star systems. After voting, you can check out the unminified version in the Github repository. Everything should work fine there.
