Zompocalpyse is a punishingly unbalanced explosion festival with zombies. The gameplay is ripped right from the now defunct ShadyPixel's BombieZombie.

I really wanted to challenge myself to build a game without any of the frameworks I've grown so dependent upon. It had been a long time since I drew to the canvas. In the end, I was definitely under the 13k limit; if I had more time, I would have put in those sound effects.
