The galaxy is ruled by the Dominion of Great Galactic Order (D.O.G.G.O.), led by the tyrannical Dog King. Their fleets crush resistance cells across the stars while the heroic T.A.I.L. (Tactical Association for Interstellar Liberation) teeters on the brink of extinction.

In a last desperate move, T.A.I.L. unveils Project Panther - a one-of-a-kind prototype starfighter with experimental feline stealth and agility technology.
As the lone pilot, you must infiltrate deep into DOGGO territory, upgrade your fragile craft, and ultimately bring down the Dog King.

*Small ship. Big mission. Nine lives won't be enough.*
