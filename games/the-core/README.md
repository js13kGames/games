You are one of many workers trapped in a factory and forced to work on THE CORE, a sinister mind control machine. The first version of THE CORE currently has everyone in the factory (workers, guards, managers) under it's control. The second version will enslave the world! Find the four keys, and use the on THE CORE to take it offline for good!

For a fun surprise, make sure to speak to a guard after you have taken the machine offline :)
