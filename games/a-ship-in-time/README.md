Oh no ! Your ship is trapped in a parallel dimension, where it is going back in time ! Instead of gaining upgrade and becoming more powerful as time passes on, it losses upgrades ! Lucky for you, your ship is very well equipped, and can select which useless upgrade to lose first. How long will you survive, and how small can your ship get?

controls :
arrow : move
space : fire
q/a, w/z, e, r : use your abilities
f : unleash your ultimate attack
enter : validate in menus

The game is infinite, so don't try to beat a level if you've already spent an hour on it and if it's past the level 10 ^^

If you have lag while playing the game, try zooming in (ctrl+wheel), it will reduce the quality of display and increase the framerate.
