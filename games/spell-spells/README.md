This is a roguelike deckbuilder where you have to collect letters and then make the best word you can to defeat monsters. Like Slay the Spire, but with words!

Story:
You are a young wizard 🧙‍♂️, just learning how to make spells. Your grandma 👵 has used her magic foresight to determine that an evil dragon 🐉 will arrive in 13 days to destroy our hometown. She gives you a book of letters so that you can learn to make spells. Until the dragon comes, you'll need to go out every night to increase your skill by defeating monsters. Why don't other help and why don't the shopkeepers just give you everything free, if you're going to save everyone's lives? Because they don't believe the dragon is real.

Strategies:
1. Keep upgrading 1 letter, like a J. Get the Zipper Mouth 🤐 so that when you don't get the J, just skip your turn. Remove lots of other letters. Get the 1st Place Medal 🥇 to 2x the first letter, since J is always the first letter.
2. Long words. Get the Nerd Face 🤓 and Slot Machine 🎰 to 5x long words. Collect exclamation marks to make it easier to make long words. Also get 🆖 and try to add ING to words to make them long.
3. Healing. Get the Syringe 💉 to damage enemies when you heal. Get the Stethoscope 🩺 and Bandage 🩹 to heal more. Collect letters that heal.
4. Paperclips. Get the Linked Paperclips 🖇 and Filing Cabinet 🗄 to boost kept letters. Collect more letters with paperclips on them.
