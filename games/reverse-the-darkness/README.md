You're hunting for "Orbs of Awesomeness" in the dark.

Tap the lamps to illuminate their surrounding area (or ... ahem ... "reverse" the darkness into light within that area) and find your way to the orb in each level.

There's only so much light in the world though, and the more lamps you activate, the smaller their illuminating circles become. To complete most levels you'll need to turn some lamps off in order to progress.

Be careful not to turn all the lamps off. It's dark out there.
