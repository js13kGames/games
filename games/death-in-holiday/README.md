You are the Death. Death wanna go in holiday but God make you work even in your spare time :)) 
Death has to save 100 souls to get rid of Gpd.
She needs to do that while jumping on platforms. To save a soul she need to hit it with a coin. Coins are collectable.
If you fall from a platform God will charge 1 coin :))
if you fail to save more souls than you miss, you loose.
If you fall from the platforms and you don't have at least 1 coin, you loose.
