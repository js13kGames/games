Captain Valen Aster is a skilled pilot, but he hides a crippling fear: triskaidekaphobia, an irrational terror of the number 13. This fear doesnâ€™t just haunt his mindâ€”it warps his vision. When triggered, Valen's field of view narrows, making it harder to see and react to threats.

Years ago, Valen barely escaped an attack in the 13th Sector, where his crew was lost. Ever since, his phobia has grown worse. Now, he's drawn back into that cursed region, where enemy waves attack relentlessly and asteroids tumble through space. The number 13 appears everywhere, threatening to trigger his vision loss at the worst moments.

To survive, Valen must control his fear and stay sharp as his vision narrows. Will he escape the sectorâ€™s curse, or will his phobia blind him to his doom?

Use the arrow or WASD keys to control your ship and space to shoot.

This game is a tribute to those classic space shooters available on 8 bit consoles. Have fun!
