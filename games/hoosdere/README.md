Hoosdere (read as who's there, original, I know) is a minimal creepy game.
You found yourself lost in the middle of a dark forest. You can barely see the exit. And you're definitely not alone.

Controls are A/D or Lelft/Right to change direction of movement. W to sprint. The player always moves forward. Click to start.
