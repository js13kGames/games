## About the Black Cats

The "Black Cat" squadrons were U.S. Navy patrol squadrons, primarily using the PBY Catalina aircraft, that conducted 
night bombing operations against Japanese shipping and installations during World War II. These operations were notable
for their effectiveness and the distinctive black paint scheme of the aircraft, which helped them operate under the 
cover of darkness.
