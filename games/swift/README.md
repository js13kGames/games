SWIFT is an easy arcade game where your main objective is to fly with ship to the end of 10 different levels.
Main idea and strong inspiration: http://swiftstitch.sophiehoulden.com/demo/

Works on modern desktop and mobile browsers (at least it should ;)), which support HTML5 canvas element.

Recommended webkit browsers.

good luck and have fun :)
