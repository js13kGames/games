You work at a zoo where the animals get to roam free in the fields during the day. But when a storm is coming, you have to bring them back into their pens. You can chase them back or ride them back.

All graphics are emojis.

On desktop: arrow keys to move, space to pick up item / drop item / dismount. Phones: hold to move there, tap yourself to pick up item / drop item / dismount.

Works on iPhone, but not so much on Android because they don't have all the emojis with color built in.

The JavaScript is minified, but there is a link to the TouchBasic code in the github.
