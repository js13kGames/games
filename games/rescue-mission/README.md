Many astronauts have been lost in space, it is up to you to bring them home, this is a rescue mission. 

Objective:
Rescue as much (3 per level) astronauts as possible and then make a safe landing on the blue planet.
For landing the rocket one should go slowly (less than 70km/h) and as much perpendicular (less than 45 deg) to the planet as possible. Don't forget to use the gravity wisely, it can help you reach places you couldn't get to with just your thrusters!

    a,d - pre launching inclination
    p - toggle pause
    mouse wheel or '.' or ',' - zoom in/out
