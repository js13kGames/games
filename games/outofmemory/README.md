Become an e-burglar in this pseudo-hacking simulation where the real money comes from people data. Explore randomly generated filesystems that sometimes makes sense and take as much as you can, then go to the shop for some upgrades! Do not forget to check your stats from time to time as well and share them if they make you proud!

The whole game is played with the mouse and instructions and "lore" are available in the welcome screen. Click on : files to download them, folder to explore them, ".." to go back up in the hierarchy. You can also delete a downloaded file by clicking on it. That should get you going!
