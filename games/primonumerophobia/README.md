The fear of prime numbers. Fear them all. Especially 13!

Please read all instructions below. An introduction and tutorial were not added in game.

Don't let the timer get to 0 and avoid PRIME numbers in your score! If your score ever equals a PRIME number, bad things will happen to you, especially if it's 13!

If your score is doubles (11, 22) you will have a chance to grab a power up! Collect as many power ups as possible to aid you in higher levels.

Advance to the next level by getting to 100 or more score.

Beware of prime enemies. Contacting with them will deplete your score and freeze you for an instant, along with their shots as well. 

Place bombs to destroy enemies on contact.

If your timer gets to 0 or you make contact with a large enemy (not the common prime enemies), you will die and will restart from level 1.

Small hints around player: Bottom left green is what you should collect to get the next double, Bottom right red is what you should avoid for next prime, Top center white is your current score.

The game is quite challenging, but is quite possible to win, especially collecting lots of powerups and playing with a gamepad! Hint/spoilers at very bottom of this page.

**********Hint/Spoiler territory below**********

The mid-boss at level 7 is quite hard, but defeating it is not necessary to advance to the next level.

Highers levels do get quite hard but the final level is, you guessed it, 13. This involves a final boss fight; fortunately if you get this far dying respawns you at the final boss instead of making you restart the game.
