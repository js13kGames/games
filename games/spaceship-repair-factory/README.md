Build a factory to repair incoming spaceships in the Asteroid Belt. Build Miners to extract resources from asteroids. Use belts to move those resources to repair any ships that come into the station.

Reason unfinished: 
Ran out of time to get the file size below the limit. Other than that the game is complete (if not tested for balance).

Controls:
Mouse and keyboard. Select a building from the bottom menubar and place it in one of the rooms (where valid). Click the top-level menu to close an opened menu.
Press "R" to rotate the building. 
Press "1" - "4" to select a top-level menu, then "1" - "5" again to select a submenu item. Press "esc" to close an opened menu.
