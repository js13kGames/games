Death comes in all forms.

For billions of birds every year, death comes in the form of...windows.

Collisions with unseen windows result in billions of bird deaths annually and countless more injuries world wide!

In UNSEEN, play as a bird trying to avoid windows, collecting money, and surviving as long as possible.

Spend your money to buy upgrades, making it easier to survive and collect even more money!

Spacebar, Left Mouse, or Touch moves the bird up. Release for the bird to go down.

Coil subscribers start with some money, have have extra items in the shop!
