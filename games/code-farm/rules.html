And a final code is generated with a super logic :).<p>The final code generated with the super logic is then checked with the Farm Database. If the code doesn't match you get a 404 message asking you to play with new combination.<p>Enjoy the Code Farm!</p><button><a href=index.html>Play</a></button>
