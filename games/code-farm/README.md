Its a two player one desktop game.

Here the first player plays as Tomato and the second one as Orange(by default).

The only way to win is by connecting the three respective fruit adjacently.

You can either connect the 3 Tomato/Orange horizontally, vertically or diagonally.

Click the empty squares to fill them as Tomato/Orange when your turn.

Every time Tomato/orange wins they get a point(respective fruit). And a final code is generated with a super logic :).

The final code generated with the super logic is then checked with the Farm Database. If the code doesn't match you get a 404 message asking you to play with new combination.

Enjoy the Code Farm!
