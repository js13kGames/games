In Tube Masters, you play daredevil who is tubing down the side of a mountain. Pay attention and avoid the obstacles, while trying to get the highest score
possible!

Dodge the Red obstacles and pick up the green. The yellow pickups are speed boosts, which will give you 2x points and move you at 2x speed for 2x danger!

Use the `Right` and `Left` arrow keys to move around.
