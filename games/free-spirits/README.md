Liberate ghosts to be found within 250m of the start, before the Moon sets. The 3D terrain is limitless but the 250m boundary is marked. You have to work out where the ghosts are. There are some ghost detector devices that may help, if you can find them. Click on things to see what happens. Move around by HTML buttons or by arrow keys or by WASD keys. Some sounds are provided by web audio.
