This is a puzzle game where you use your Astronaut to collect gold nuggets in a labyrinth. There are some difficulties to navigate in zero gravity and you will have some limitations in how you can move. Your android can assist you while you float, but your android cannot collect the nuggets.

Use A, S, D, and W to control your spacewalker, and use your arrow keys to control your android.

Good luck!
