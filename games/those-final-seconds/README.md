**Those Final Seconds** is a poor attempt to make a shoot-em-up game. It could have been fun, but it is not, but I'm submitting it anyway to see how it fares.

The goal is to gain as many points as possible before you run out of time. Killing those poor, innocent enemies will give you points, but dying enemies also drop clocks that magically give you more time.

## Controls:
- **Arrow keys or WASD**: Move
- **Space/L.Ctrl/Z:** Shoot
- **Enter/Escape:** Pause


## !!! IMPORTANT !!!

Play on Firefox or Chrome/Chromium to get the audio working properly. On Firefox avoid private browsing since it might cause graphics bugs for an unknown reason.
