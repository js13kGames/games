For the “fear or avoidance of the number 13” I did something to be the antithesis to the JS13K, but still feet in the rules. This is a true JSZeroK Minesweeper game, and all game logic is implemented in CSS.

This is a pair game. Ask you friend, or mate, or smart dog to place the bombs, and start the game, so you can enjoy this classic with a nice style on your desktop or mobile.
