This is an interpretation of the rules of the ancient Game of Ur, possibly a predecessor of the Backgammon. It's a two-player race board game, here the players take turns tossing 4 coins to move their pieces through the board. The first player to ascend (take off the board after completing the course) 7 pieces win.

I strongly recommend you to read the Wikipedia page "Royal Game of Ur" to better understand the rules and the historical reconstruction of them.
