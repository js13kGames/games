10,048 tribbles are spread throughout the universe.

Today, nearing the end of the Great Tribble Hunt, only a few of the most unique and well disguised tribbles remain.

Find them quickly, before they start to multiply again!

The last time we left them alone the universe was almost overrun...

## The Tribbles:

If you find one before anyone else it's yours forever!

You'll need a NEAR TestNet account: https://wallet.testnet.near.org/

## The Game:

Click around the star map to hunt for tribbles! 

Look out for tribble gear to create your own unique tribbles, export the image, and create you own NFTs on any NFT platform!

## The Challenges:
