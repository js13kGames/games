This is a mobile game inspired by pinball, based on the device's accelerometer.
You can also play this on a desktop and use your mouse to define the table rotation.
(I think will be better to understand if you try it on a desktop first)

⚠️ It will take time to build in the first time. The next page load will be much faster!

Features:
* 6 levels.
* Travel between then using wormholes.
* Drop out the safe limits will kill the ball. Attention on tables without walls and specially on "Inferno", where the safe limit is only the painted area.
* Black holes will kill the ball.
* The harder you hit the pin, more points you get.
* Points will give you a new ball, starting at 150, and a life up, starting at 1000.
* Your life counter are the 3 rockets at the top. You can't have more than 3 lives at time.
* You lost a life when you reach zero balls on the table.
* If you don't reach zero lives, you lost one for a new ball.
* The game will remember your record in this browser.
