Neighborhood kids caught a wind of you getting a giant trampoline and want to play.
Though, they have no safety training, so you have no choice but politely send them BACK.
They may object, but a strong enough kick makes them lose control temporarily, letting you usher them out.
You get a point for each de-trampolined kid.
If you fall off, you lose 5 points.<br/>
Game ends when there are 15 kids present (including you).

Move with WASD (for player 1) or arrow keys (for player 2). P to pause. ESC to reset.

Have fun, and don't act recklessly or agressively on trampoline in real life!
