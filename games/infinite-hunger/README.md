# Infinite Hunger

...is a simple endless arcade platformer action thingy. You control a black cat who has to keep eating otherwise a single hit by a red-nosed slime can kill you. 

## Game mechanics explained

The goal is to get as many points as possible. The following actions give you points:

- **Stomping an enemy**. This also gives you an additional score multiplier as long as you stay in the air.
- **Eating an enemy**. Catch an enemy with your tongue and eat it. This gives you fewer points than stomping, but it will also refill your hunger bar.
- **Collecting a coin**. This gives the least points, but it increases the score multiplier (under "BONUS" text).

## Controls:
(Note: Z and X can be different on non-qwerty keyboards, but they are always the keys you can find above your left alt)

- **Arrow keys**: Move
- **Space or Z**: Jump
- **Left Ctrl or X**: Launch your tongue. This is used to eat enemies.
- **Escape or Enter**: Pause game.
