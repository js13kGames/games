In a world where the game cannot be found, you point your browser to the venerable search engine.

Overcome the obstacles of the uncharted Internet, such as paywalls, dark patterns, and web standards.

You have to walk this path alone.

You want to google the game.

Controls: pull, then release.

Mobile Chrome: use "Add to Home screen" for the best experience.

Web Monetization: play as the Chrome browser!

Web Piracy (if you don't have Web Monetization): add `?piracy=1` to the URL.

You can also undo the effect of Web Monetization by appending `?firefox=1`.

Thanks for playing! :)
