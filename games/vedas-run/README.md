"I'm Veda, last of the Tech Savants. It's been 12 years since the Machines took over. The world is unrecognizable now, humanity is on it's last breath. Cerberus has completed the Quantum Tower. All is lost if the Machines turn it on.
It has to be shut down. This ends now."

Veda's Run is a 3D third-person runner with a conversational UI, basic skeletal animation, procedural and manual tiles, loads of effects, a boss "battle", and multiple endings including a secret ending :). Play till the end to get the "Lost" theme. 

This was so much fun to build, and it blows me away just what can be done in the browser these days, in 13K no less!
