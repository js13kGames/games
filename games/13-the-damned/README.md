In 13 the Damned, a card game inspired by triskaidekaphobia—the fear of the number 13—every decision is a gamble with fate. Flip cards, accumulate points, and push your luck. But beware, revealing a King (worth 13) spells doom, ending the game in an instant. Will you risk it all or walk away before it’s too late? With three levels of difficulty and a rising score multiplier for every card revealed, every choice could lead you to victory or disaster.

## How to Play

1. 12 cards are randomly picked from a standard 54-card deck and placed face-down on the board.
2. Reveal cards one by one, each with a value from 1 to 13 (King = 13).
3. Accumulate the values of the revealed cards, but don’t let the total exceed 13 points, or you’ll lose those cards.
4. For each card you reveal without clicking **Keep Cards**, your score multiplier increases by 1, boosting your potential score.
5. You can lock in your score at any time by pressing **Keep Cards**, or end the game early with **End Game** to save your total.
6. Be cautious! Revealing a King will instantly end the game, marking you as damned.

## Difficulty Levels

* **Easy**: No Kings will appear, but your final score is multiplied by 0.75.
* **Normal**: One King may appear, with a score multiplier of 1x.
* **Hard**: Two Kings could appear, with a score multiplier of 2x.
