sing-song ding-dong
a js13games 2019 entry by richard munn

Turfed out of your home for your awful singing, you must explore the Mysterious Caves, defeat the Mysterious Monsters, retrieve the Mysterious Musical Notes and collect the Mysterious Gems so that your songs might become a bit less awful.

A 80s inspired arcade action platformer set over four worlds, with over forty stages of singing-at-beasties-and-jumping-on-their-heads action.
