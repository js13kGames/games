FyraNollFyra is a mathematical puzzle game where the objective is to spell out 4, 0 and 4 in three containers. To do so you need to move numbers and operators until the equations in the containers reach their desired result.

A total of six trophies are hidden throughout the three sections of levels and the tutorial.

There is a hint function to assist you if you get stuck. Coil subscribers get the 10th of the normal cooldown until the hint function get ready again after use.

The game is adapted for mobile devices. To achieve the best result on tablet or mobil, allow the game to be installed on the start screen as a Progressive Web App (PWA).

Fyra noll fyra means four zero four in Swedish.
