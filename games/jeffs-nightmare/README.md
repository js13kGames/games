*Can be played with or without decentralized!*
Controls: Mouse to move. Click to fire.

STORY: Jeff is having nightmares before his big space launch. As long as his courage holds up he'll keep sleeping. 

DECENTRALIZED:
NEAR: log-in/log-out, getAccountID
(notes: I wanted to do more with NEAR, but implementing the contract methods was too much of a learning curve for me. I would have liked to implement a signed visitor's book.) 

PROTOCOL LABS:
I pulled in a random value from Drand and looped through the digits to set the speed of the monsters. 
See code: drand() and useRandom() lines 245-263

Amusing note: This is a spin-off of my other game, when I was trying to get the decentralized tech working I didn't want to have to work around my full-sized game, so I did this less complicated one and as I got some things working the game just filled out a bit.
