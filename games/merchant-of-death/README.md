You are a gentleman merchant, grave-robbing and selling disreputable goods to the upper class.
After spending your nights gathering materials, sell them to your discerning patrons at high prices.           
You seek the legendary blue diamond, buried with one of the world's elite.

Move with WASD, ZQSD or the arrow keys, or click or tap next to your character to dig in that direction.
Tap fast, you've got to dig up as many graves as you can before the night is over!
