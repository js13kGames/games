Logic Shooter is a game which you have to destroy the error that doesnâ€™t allow the page to be found.
The only way to defeat it is by supplying the logic gates inputs with energy. This can be done by pressing the buttons in the bottom left, and if you want to change the position of the logic gates, you can rotate them by pressing the buttons in the bottom right. 
You can also press the a, s, left arrow and right arrow keys to perform the same actions.
The one on the left is an And Logic Gate. Its TWO inputs must be supplied with     energy in order to shoot the error. 
The one on the top is an Or Logic Gate. Just ONE of its inputs needs to be supplied with energy in order to shoot the error.
Lastly, keep in mind that you lose energy every time an input is activated. You also need to mind the timer to avoid running out of time. Good luck!! c:
