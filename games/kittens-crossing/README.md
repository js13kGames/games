In a careless moment you let your tiny kitten siblings out of your sight. 
Now they are all lost in the big and dangerous city. 
Soon you won't just be a black cat, you will be the black sheep of the family.
Unless, you can get them all safely home.

Definitely PG-13 for cat lovers, because you can't save them all...

Play on Quest with the thumb stick (only one controller needed, after start enter VR!).
