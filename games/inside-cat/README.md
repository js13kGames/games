You're the legendary cat burglar they call **The Shadow.** Nine heists in nine months. Nobody knows how you do it. They think you must always have an accomplice. An inside man.

They're wrong... but they're close. You have an inside *cat*.

**INSTRUCTIONS:**
Use your laser pointer (right controller) to lure your pet cat, Cinnamon, to adjacent tiles. Get him to turn off the alarms and open the exit so you can come in and swipe the jewel. Be careful - Cinnamon hates bright light.

Use your right thumb toggle to strafe right or left.

**NOTES**
Well, level 3 was going to be where the mirror actually matters, but it broke, and I was over 13kb, so I just yanked it. 

Other ideas:
* A mouse that overrides your laser and cause the cat to chase it back to its mouse hole
* Fear of the cat in the mirror if he's too close to the mirror
* Shadows - they stopped working, so you can't hide in shadows. :(
