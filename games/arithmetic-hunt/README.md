- Move your circle by mouse in order to hit the right expressions and to avoid the incorrect ones.
- Think fast! You have 15 seconds to find next correct expression.
- Small balls are neither dangerous nor count as correct ones.
- As the games goes, the expressions become a bit more complicated and their number increases.
- To show / hide help (while the game is over) use ESC
- To start / restart the game hit SPACE

Good luck!
