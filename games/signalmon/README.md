Signalmon is a tamagochi-like game for mobile browsers. Signalmon has 3 basic needs: Food, Sleep, Fun.

## Creatures

Wiflies: These insects thrive when there's a network connection. If you are offline, they starve and die. They decrease Signalmon's mood.
Buzzards: These reptiles appear when there are loud noises. When it's quiet, they sneak away. They increase Signalmon's mood.

## Controls:
- Keep it happy to earn money
- Buy a toy and play around with it
- Feed him dead wiflies
- Go offline to get rid of flies
- Make loud noises to attract buzzards
- Upgrade its bed so it sleeps better
