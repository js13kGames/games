This is my third entry for JS13k this year.

It’s more of a tech demo than a real game. It started as an experiment to see how much content of a Minecraft like clone could be done in 13kB. When I was done with the engine I started to play around with some small gameplay fitting the space theme and since I have spent some time on this I figured I could submit it anyway.

Normal FPS controls:

Move around with WASD
Jump with space.
Use the mouse to look around and the left mouse button to shoot at the invaders (or destroy the world yourself).

There is no real goal apart from survive. 

It works best in Chrome but all major browsers are supported. 

Jumping up trough trees is intended and not a bug.

Each game play has a randomised world generated during startup.

It’s a bit memory hungry and requires a good GPU to play but I have tried to optimise as much as possible.
