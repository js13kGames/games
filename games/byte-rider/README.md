Byte Rider is a two player card game, you against an AI. On your turn you may take one action...

1. Draw a card and add it to your hand.
2. Play a point card and score its value.
3. Discard a point card to trigger an effect.
4. Play a non-point card to trigger a permanent effect.
5. Play a point card on an equal or lower value point card. Discard both cards.

...then it's the AI's turn. The first to reach 21 points wins.
