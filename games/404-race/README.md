Race to win in forsaken and utterly lost - likely not even found - locations on Tat404ine and End404r. 

To advance to the next race you must place 1st. 

Control your droid with keyboard WASD and arrow keys. Four red squares appears to indicate the keyboard support. 
	
For touch screen the droid follows your touch. This is indicated by red circle and white dot. The droid turns and accelerates to the compass point.

In case you feel like supporting the game, you will get to drive 404 Vader who probably has lost their trophy and themselves and does not appear in the game otherwise. 404 Vader is Luke's parent and possibly all the droids too. So, it is kind of a big deal. But the experience is mostly cosmetic.
