The bad and generic EVILCORP is believed to have come up with evil plans. As a ninja, your goal is to find those evil plans by hacking into its computers as quickly as possible.

Find your way through a series of levels as fast as you can. Shortcuts are always available and speedrunning is highly encouraged.

The game features four difficulty modes: normal, easy, very easy, and nightmare. Difficulty can be set at any time during the game.

Coil subscribers get an extra PRACTICE mode allowing them to go through the levels without having to worry about being detected.
