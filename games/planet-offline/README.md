Rogue AI has infected the planet! And worse, it has taken over all defense systems and shut down the planetary network! We cannot access the data we need in order to stop it. It is a very dangerous mission, but we need you to fly across the planet and manually uplink with our ground databanks in the hopes that we can shut down the AI once and for all. The more uplinks you complete, the better off we'll be, and the better score you'll have.
