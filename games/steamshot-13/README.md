A shooting gallery in a steampunk style. 

The targets get faster and faster. Score points by hitting a **green** ball, lose points by hitting a **red** ball. You must shoot the **black 13** balls to survive. Miss a 13 ball and it's **gameover.** *How long can you survive?*

There's a leaderboard so **play with your friends**, but only on the same device. *Scoring uses localStorage.*

This **WebXR** game is only playable on a **VR headset**. Use the trigger button on the controllers to shoot. The game uses **ThreeJS** and several *tricks* to create the environment within the 13k limit. No assets are used, everything is created at run time.
