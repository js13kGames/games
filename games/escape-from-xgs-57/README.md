Escape from XGS-57 is a real-time survival strategy game inspired by Frostpunk and Subnautica. You play a space trader who crashed onto the water planet XGS-57 and must remote control your gadgets on site to rebuild a rocket and escape.

Space will be very important in this game, as it is a scarce resource and most of your actions will have space restrictions. (E.g. building placement, water level)

Controls:
WASD to move camera
Q and E to shift perspectives
C to cancel something you're about to build
X to rotate building placement
P to pause
Everything else can be handled by the mouse!

Pay attention to your water! Don't let it run out!

Happy escaping!
