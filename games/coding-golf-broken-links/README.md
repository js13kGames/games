Planet Figadore is ravaged by the Regolith virus, so all sporting events have been cancelled. Fred sneaks on to the "Coding Golf" island golf course, to play 18 holes and win the "Broken Links" championship trophy.

Use the left/right cursor keys to rotate the direction the ball will be struck in, then select a golf club using the up/down arrows to adjust the range. Once you're happy, press SPACE/ENTER to start the swing meter. Then pressing SPACE/ENTER a second time will select a strike power (as a percentage), the meter will now move back towards 0. You then need to press SPACE/ENTER a final time as close to 0 as you can to prevent a hooked or sliced shot.

Alternatively you can use a mouse to play, use the scroll wheel will rotate the ball direction, then click for each step of the swing meter operation. You still need to use up/down cursors to change clubs.

With added OS13k trophies.
