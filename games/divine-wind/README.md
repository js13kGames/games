The Mongols are invading Japan and only you, the Kamikaze, or Divine Wind, can stop them.

Use the wind channels to blow the Mongols away. You need to unscramble each concentric layer so that there is a path from bottom to top. Once the maze is unscrambled, punch through the maze with your right hand to blow the ships away!

Use your right controller to click and drag the concentric layers.
