The 13th-century was a time of nautical innovation. The caravel was in development and early charts were being made. It's your turn to captain an expedition to map uncharted waters and become a legendary explorer!

Portolani is a turn-based puzzle game. Your goal is to visit all of the ports, exploring as much of the map as possible. A new map is released every day at 00:00 UTC.

An optional leaderboard for the daily challenge is available via the NEAR testnet. If you would like to save your high score, please sign in to your testnet MyNearWallet (<https://testnet.mynearwallet.com>)!

Portolani is available on IPFS at:
