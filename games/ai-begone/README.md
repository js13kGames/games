Back the human revolution against an evil AI in this perma-death orbital-physics shoot-them-up!

You must destroy all AI cities. To do so you have to mine resources on abandoned planets, sell them on a target planet, and, once resources are high enough, attack a enemy city (red) to start a war.

- W/S: Forward/Backwards
- A/D: Rotate
- Q/E: Strafe
- Space: Stop rotation
- L: Lock camera
- F: Focus vehicle
- T: Planet info (hover planet)
- ,/.: Timewarp (You can do it while mining!)
- LMB: Fire guns 
- RMB: Reference frame 
- MMB: Camera focus 
- Wheel: Change zoom
- F2: Hide HUD
- F3: Mute music

Your navigation tools are the orbit predictor (pink line) and the navcircle:
- Yellow Strip: Prograde, your direction of motion
- Blue Strip: Normal
- Short Strips: Opposite to long strips

To move between planets set your reference frame to one, burn towards it until your orbit gets close, and timewarp until you have arrived. Make sure to slowdown!
