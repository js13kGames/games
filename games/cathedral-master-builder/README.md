Welcome to the 13th century, a time when magnificent cathedrals adorn the skyline of every major city, except yours.

You've been appointed as the CATHEDRAL MASTER BUILDER by the bishop to build a cathedral before the century's end.

The bishop✝️ provides money💵 for your project. Visit the TOWN🏘️ to recruit skilled workers for your BAKERY🥖, SMITHY⚒️, and MASONRY🧱. Procure iron🧲 and stone🧱 from the MARKET🧺.
