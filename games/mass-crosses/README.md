# The Game
A Tic-Tac-Toe with a replace rule, where a massive body can replace any other with less mass. To be played in decentralized fashion.


# Why is Unfinished
I try to implement this game in one day after I have finished my first entry (SpacePinball). However, I could not discover what was wrong with my contract implementation, as I'm new to NEAR or any Blockchain implementation. Another problem is to rewrite to import libs from NEAR service. The boilerplate includes all dependencies in the build, so, this is big.

At least you can see beautiful CSS only stellar bodies.
