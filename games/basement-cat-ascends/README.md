A 2D platformer created for js13kGames 2025.
You play as a black cat starting in the basement and climbing your way up through the house, room by room, until you reach the attic — gaining new abilities along the way. Beating the game unlocks additional challenge modes.

Supports both keyboard and gamepad controls:
Jump: Space / A
Move: WASD or Arrow keys
Wall Jump: Jump while pressing against the wall
Pause: Enter / Start
Dash: Down + Jump (unlocked later)

There are no sounds — I wasn’t able to fit them in. Apologies!

A short but challenging game built under the 13k limit.
