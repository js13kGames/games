In Italy, people say that black cats bring bad luck. But donâ€™t worryâ€”you can chase the curse away! When a black cat appears, scream into your microphone to scare it off and earn a lucky point.

Points are shown as horn signs (ðŸ¤˜), a traditional Italian gesture believed to keep misfortune away.

Be careful:

Stay silent when you see a non-black cat, or youâ€™ll lose a point.

Miss a scream when a black cat shows up, and youâ€™ll lose a point too!

Run out of points and the game is over.

Survive long enough to reach 7 pointsâ€”just like the 7 lives every cat hasâ€”and youâ€™ll advance to the next level, where the cats move faster and the challenge grows tougher.

ðŸŽ¤ To play, make sure your microphone is on and find a quiet place to shout your way to victory!
