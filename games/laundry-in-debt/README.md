You are a laundromat owner in a place where every **13:00**, an absurd amount of bills will be given to your laundromat account. Installing more machines in your laundromat will increase your income and daily bills. You also will be accompanied by a mysterious and calculative Wallow who will gladly trade some of his washing machines with you.

## Rules

1. When the clock reaches **13:00**, some coins will be deducted from your laundromat account based on the amount of machines you have installed.
2. When someone sells a machine to Wallow, he will pay less amount of coin for the next player that sells that same machine to him.
3. When someone buys a machine from Wallow, he will pay more coins for the next player who sells that same machine to him.

## How To Play
