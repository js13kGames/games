The Horde have destroyed nearby cities and ports. Our city may be next! Help your fellow citizens flee to safety and get our mighty soldiers across the river to battle The Horde!

Alas, a cruel and cunning enemy spy destroyed the existing bridges. Fear not! Some highly confident but, not so skilled, citizens have built fancy extendable makeshift ones!

Don't leave your fellow citizens waiting too long to cross the river as they may panic and drown attempting to cross the river themselves!

### Controls
Left mouse button down to extend the bridges.

Move bridges left or right with your mouse to avoid any burning ships travelling down the river.
