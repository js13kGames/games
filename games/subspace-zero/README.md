Drop into Subspace and battle other bots and players. Features dynamically generated pixel art (ie theres not a single .png sprite file involved in this game) and a basic multiplayer implementation!

*Note: Combat was still very WIP by the end of the jam - and not at all implemented in this submitted build. This is just the unfinished stage of the game at the time of the gamejam end.

Issues:
*Build came in at ~17kb, needed more time to optimise the code
*Scope: Too large and complex = larger codebase and more chance of issues
*Bugs: Had some large issues pop up in the final days which burnt a lot of time I otherwise would have needed to finalize the game loop
