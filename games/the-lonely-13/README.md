It's a memory-type matching game with a small town murder ambiance.

Match at least two pairs, then click on the "healing pairs" button at the center top before the spiders make it back up to the button.

At the end of every round, you get options on how to spend your matches.  

More matches == more healing. Also, some rounds have special options.

At least one person must survive all 13 rounds.

Good Luck ðŸ¤ž
