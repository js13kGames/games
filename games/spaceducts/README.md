There's a lot of space out there ... between the walls of your ship. Connect broken pipes and wires deep in the belly of your ship. Fix it and get to the next wormhole. But don't drown or get electrocuted along the way! Play through 4 increasingly difficult levels to get your ship back into working order.

Plays on Vive, Oculus, and Desktop.

Controls:
General: Once a pipe snaps into place, you can pick up or create another.  You cannot pick up filled pipes or live wires.

Vive/Oculus - Teleport with thumbpad/thumbstick. Grab or create pipes with trigger. Long-press thumbpad/thumbstick to give up if you get stuck.

Desktop - WASD + mouse. Click to pick up or create a pipe. "Q"/"E" and "R"/"F" to rotate a pipe. Click again to place. "L" to give up if you get stuck.
