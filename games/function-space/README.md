A logic puzzle game that is about transforming source numbers into target numbers.
To do that, the "function machines" must be in the right places!

There are 10 levels. The first 6 levels are introductory levels.
The last 4 levels require a little bit more thoughts.

[Control]
Mouse click or finger tap is all you need.

[Note]
Unfortunately, I am running out of time.
So there isn't additional feature for the web monetization category.
