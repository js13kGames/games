You start with $30, you can afford a Nerd (from the first table, below Producer). After the first 33s of the game, you can then afford hiring another, and so on.
Each unit produces a certain amount of $$$, you can increase this money per unit by getting the units better OS's. You can buy more than just one unit, with the More upgrade (which costs other units).
Goal:
GET TO A MILLION UNITS TOTAL BEFORE TIME RUNS OUT! Otherwise you just lost the game.
