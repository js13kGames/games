My first attempt at entering JS13K, and my first serious attempt at using JavaScript to make a game. 

So as a result I failed spectacularly. The game "works", it can't be finished. It's essentially a text-adventure game with a fancy starfield, a couple of plot-points, a help screen and a lot of test code. 

On the positive side, I've learned a ton about Javascript. JS13K got me hooked on watching Crockford's talks, and studying the language in-depth.
