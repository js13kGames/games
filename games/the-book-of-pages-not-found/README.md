"The Book of Pages Not Found" is a short story-driven game inspired by classic choose-your-own-adventure game books and Grimms' Fairy Tales.

You must explore this book and uncover the long-forgotten stories. Find the shape of how they’ve been, or form them how they could be, and fill these pages with the ink long gone…

Will you find all the pages?
