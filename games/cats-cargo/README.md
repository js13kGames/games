🎮 Hey! I'm Jude, a 16-year-old dev, and this is… Cats Cargo! 🐾

Step into the paws of a black cat (surprise!) and become the ultimate rooftop delivery hero… for mice. Why mice? Who knows, but they need your help! Your mission: pick up as many mice and stack them on your back as you can and deliver them safely. But watch out the more mice you have the slower you are so you will have to balance that with the ticking clock—without plummeting into the deadly pits below.

⏰ Time is ticking! Each level gets trickier, so you’ll need speed, precision, and nerves of steel. Stack your furry cargo and race to the ELEVATOR… or the mice are doomed!

💥 Controls That Feel Just Right:

Move: A / D

Jump: W or Space

Drop mice: Q (either at the drop station… or anywhere if you’re impatient)

Reset: R (for when things go wrong)

🎯 Optional Controls:

Arrow keys to move, Space to jump, Q to drop, R to reset.

☝️ Pro Tip: Press SPACE three times to start and prepare for chaos!

I hope Cats Cargo makes your day a little brighter—and your reflexes a lot sharper. Have fun! 😸
