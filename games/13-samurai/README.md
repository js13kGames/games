### How I made it

Hi, I'm Andrei, I'm 12 years old and I made this! The project was kind of ambitious, for the size limit and given that I will not be at home for most of the jam's duration, but I'm happy I made it! The first thing I bumped into was the WebGL renderer. My knowledge in 3d graphics is theoretical and rare, but with the help of my amazing father, I managed to pull it off in the first few days.

I thought I could make a generative island with perlin noise, but it looked like a 3 year old made it. So I made the island shape in blender, and generated some trees. Simple as pie! Only then I realised that I had to convert those .blend files into something my renderer would understand. So I spent a couple of days making a obj to vertices and indices, only then to realise it was too big. I wanted to make it in binary encoding, but nah, JSON!

And then I made a samurai. It took two remakes to make it not look like a potato. And I had to animate it. Man, I really miss Three.js. But I managed to do that.

And then I found out in the last couple of days that I needed music. I thought I could make my own synth, like last year, but my brain was empty. After one day of struggling, I gave up and used zzFxM. Cringe, but at least it works.

Oh, but wait. I don't have a start screen. I always forget to do the start screen in game jams. I just made it quick and dirty at the end. Nice.

So finally, I can upload and boom! Done and dusted. It was a hard challenge juggling between code golfing, simplicity, webGL, and hardcore mathematics, while doing a lot of schoolwork. I really hope you like itðŸ’–

I used VSCode, Blender for modeling, zzFx for sound and music, and a small part of sanity
