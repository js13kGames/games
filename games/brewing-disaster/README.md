You are a wizard and you want to be the very best!

To be so, you have to duel other wizards.

You share a cauldron with another wizard.
This cauldron has an amount of _putridity_.
Add ingredients to the cauldron to increase or decrease its _putridity_.

First wizard to reach an amount of _putridity_ of **13** or **0** has **lost**!

## Gameplay

__Brewing Disaster__ is a deck-building game. You start with some ingredients and, after each victory, you can add new ingredients to your deck. Sometimes you can even improve some!

A game of __Brewing Disaster__  makes you face 4 wizards NPC with their own deck and passive effects. You'll duel them twice: the first encounter will be easy, but the second one will be thougher!

Win 8 duels in a row with a character to unlock another one!

## Mobile devices

Even if it's optimized for desktop, the game should be playable on tablets and smartphones (espcially on portrait mode).  
But have in mind the experience is a bit degraded on small screens!

## Decentralized challenge

### OP Guild 

Goal of the game is to beat 4 NPCs. Each of them has its own deck of ingredients (and passives for the second encounter).

We can unlock NPC to play with their ingredients as starter deck (well, that means they aren't NPC anymore, but I hope it's still OK, let's say it's original to transform an NPC into a PC :p).

### Arcadia Challenge

This game is available on [Arcadia](https://arcadia.fun/games/cda7cc2b-7acb-432a-aff2-121aa7358898/).

### Thirdweb

The first time a player looses a game, it unlocks an optional feature based on Thirdweb: being able to create and save its very own starter ingredients.
When playing with a custom starter deck, we can't unlock other characters: this is just a bonus to test things :)
