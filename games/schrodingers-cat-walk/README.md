Schrödinger’s Catwalk 🐾

You are a mysterious black cat wandering between two realities — one where you are lucky, and one where you are cursed.

Every action you take affects both worlds at once.

In the Lucky World, platforms appear and humans pet you.

In the Unlucky World, traps appear and humans chase you.

Can you balance both sides of fate and keep the cat alive? Or will you vanish into paradox… 🌀
