Set in Scotland in 1276. You are real person that existed at the time. You travel to castles that existed in the 13th century on real and plausible path that will take you to battle King Alexander III where he lives.

Atmospheric sounds. Effects that are near one side of the screen are louder on that speaker. Works on phones too if you have headphones. Two 13th century songs. One 18th century song written in Scotland. One song written by me for this game.
