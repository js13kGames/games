This was supposed to be an epic strategy game where you controlled a civilisation, guiding them to prosper for the longest time possible. They would not be alone in the world - other players and their ruins would be scattered around the shared world.

However we're not at uni any more and overestimated how much free time we had. Combined with an ambitious premise, we did not really make something playable. There is terrain generation as well as water flow and vegetation simulation all written in Rust. Which we think is pretty neat.
