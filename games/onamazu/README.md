# Ōnamazu

Ōnamazu is a giant catfish that lives under the Japanese islands and is known for causing earthquakes. Or maybe he warns people about upcoming earthquakes? It's a bit of both, really. 

## Controls 
Arrows or WASD to move
Space to attack/thrash

## Mechanics
Eating fish fills the energy bar. To do so, you must hit the fish's body with Onamazu's head. Otherwise, they will just swim over each other. Once it is one-third full, Ōnamazu can thrash hard enough to sink boats and becomes invulnerable for a moment. When the bar is full, thrashing will ring nearby bells.

To finish the level, you must ring all the temple bells to warn people about the upcoming earthquake.

## Unfortunately

I ran out of time, so there is no sound and only four levels are available.
