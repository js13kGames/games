You have to avoid the objects shoot at the ball by two buttons, one moves the ball clockwise and other anti-clockwise.
The more you are able to avoid ,the more you score.
Offline mode will provide an extra color illusion as a amazing challenge to play.
Hints: the trick is dealing with buttons to move clock/anti-clockwise is different from buttons to move left/right and remember the direction to shift as a rotation not movement.
