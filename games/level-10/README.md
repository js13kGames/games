Level 10 is a game of skill, coordination, and patience. You must control the ball by manipulating the bar to avoid the trap holes and target the lit holes. Score more points the faster you are!

Level 10 is based on the popular arcade game 'Ice Cold Beer' by Taito.

Game Modes:
Classic: The classic Ice Cold Beer game rules. Maneuver the ball into the lit holes in succession as fast as you can avoiding the trap holes. Players start with 3 balls and can earn another by reaching the 8th hole. Reaching the 10th hole will reset the progression but not your score!
Survival: Continually lift the ball higher and higher to increase your score. Avoid all the holes!

Default Controls:
Left Side Up : a
Left Side Down: z
Right Side Up: k
Right Side Down: m

Players can modify the controls (for international keyboards) via the start screen.
