A walk through life, however thorough,
Ends on a hill a bit too steep.
Bear witness, not to strife and sorrow, â€“
Bare neatness of eternal sleep.

If you feel it's too easy, try the Coil levels from the level select screen. They are cursedly hard. (If you don't have Coil, append #coil to the URL.)

For best experience on Android, use the 'Add to Home screen' feature. Seriously, it's amazing how much better the game runs if started from that shortcut.

Thank you for playing!

Web Monetization features: there are three bonus levels accessible to Coil subscribers. Extra hard!

Decentralized features and which Challenge you've taken: the OP Games Challenge.

As explained by Paul Gadi on Slack, The Neatness should qualify because (1) it's open source / free software (released under GPLv3), (2) it's built on open source libraries and web standards / protocols.
