Goal of the game is to rearrange cards, connected by string in a way that strings do not overlap other cards.

Controls are pretty self evident - just drag and drop cards.

Game autosaves after each move, so you can stop and restart it anytime.

There are also kind of cheat keys. 1-5 jumps to respective level. 6 jumps you to "free play" mode where you can generate boards based on the seed.
