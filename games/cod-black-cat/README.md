You're **BLACK CAT**, a _cybernetically altered trooper_ sent in to stop a rodent uprising. Infiltrate a household, block mouseholes, hunt down a ticking cheeseâ€‘bomb and hold the trigger to defuse it before time runs out. You get 10 minutes and 9 lives... Lose them all and it's game over.

## How to play (controls)

- Left stick => walk
- Left trigger => interact
- Right stick => rotate
