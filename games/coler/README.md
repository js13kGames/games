Controls:

Left Right to move.
Down to look down.
X to jump.
Enter to see progress.

There are 5 levels, and 12 collectibles.

There is wall jumping. And jump grace where you can still jump a few frames after you leave the ground, which you have to use to pass levels. Spikes have a smaller hit-box than they look.
