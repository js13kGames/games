> If I'd written the mapping module, it wouldn't be offline!

Well, JÃ¶rg didn't write the module and as a result we now have a robot that doesn't know the way back anymore because the mapping module is offline. Fortunately, the remote interface is working as expected.

Easy Controls: Arrow keys, T = Turbo, C = Camera

Differential Drive Controls: W/S = Left wheel, I/K = Right Wheel, SPACE = Turbo, C = Camera

The game requires a keyboard.
