A little game I made for fun. It was a course of challenge, as this was my first project on a competition like this,
in the beggining it went a little slow on designing the concept but it made it out.
Beggining school I just barely managed to get it sumbitted until 13:00 CEST, using a remote desktop connection
to get my files. Hard process, but in the end a great achievement.
