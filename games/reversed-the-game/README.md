Reversed: The Game is a one-button platformer / puzzle, where instead of controlling the protagonist directly, you're manipulating gravity. Newton would be proud.

HOW TO PLAY

Click or tap anywhere on the screen to reverse the direction of the free fall! Pass the increasingly menacing levels to save the princess! A surprising plot twist awaits you at the end of your epic journey, so don't give up easily ;)

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

The game should work in any modern browser, including mobile ones.

On desktop, Chrome is probably the best choice.
On mobile, Safari on iPad wins hands down.
