When a rogue browser tab decides to start playing an obnoxiously loud video, only a toughened user will try to stop it! It's up to you to find the damned tab and put it out of its misery! 

However, this won't be an easy journey, the villainous sourcerer Adne Twork has placed some magic locks that will block your way, so you will need to find the appropriate keys; and the chaos paladin Inex Perienceddev has placed some bombs that will explode tearing the tcp-ip continuum. However, if you find the legendary Map of Fil Tereduce, your quest will be easier...

Good luck!
