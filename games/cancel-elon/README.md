the roguelike deckbuilder we deserve. collect emojis as cards to build ur deck, and play them in the best way to make social media posts.

STORY - ur Triska the black cat. u need to cancel elon [^1] to reclaim the internet. first u need to build up ur skill by cancelling other idiots. then u can take 1 of their emojis to improve ur deck.

HOW TO PLAY - u need to use the most poopy emojis to downvote your enemy's post as hard as possible so they lose all their fans. if ur post is voted negative, u will lose that many fans. it's hard to gain fans so first make sure ur post is positive. it doesn't help to upvote your post more when it's already positive, except that the highest voted post gains +1 fan.
