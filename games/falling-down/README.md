'Falling Down' is a simple platform game with the goal of jumping as far down as possible.

How to Play

The game is controlled by mouse only:

- Control the hero by moving the mouse cursor from side to side
- Use the left button to start and restart the game

(It may be a good idea to use a mouse and not a touchpad for controlling the game properly)
