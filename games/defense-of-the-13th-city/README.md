### Game description
Defend the city from the attackers! Recruit soldiers, and build various buildings to succeed.

You have two resources: **gold** and **food**.
You need gold to recruit soldiers, build buildings, and purchase upgrades.
You need food to keep your soldiers alive. If you run out of food, your soldiers will start losing health.

Your goal is to defend the castle, which is the main building of the city. If the enemy destroys it, you lose.

The soldiers start at the castle, and walk towards the enemy. The enemy soldiers are coming from outside the city. When the friendly and enemy soldiers are close to each other, they'll fight.
