A space roomba simulator and and exercise in procedural generation. Sequel to https://boundless-city.netlify.app and https://marshmallow-sky.netlify.app

Warp Station 13K has a serious space debris problem. Your job is to fly around and collect it. You get points for collecting debris, depending on how fast you are moving, how clean city already is and some other factors. Controls: mouse buttons to accelerate and decelerate, Space to toggle menu.

I'm planning to continue developing part of it as a general purpose size-optimized webgl library (like twgl or ogl), so if you are interested, keep an eye on my twitter and/or github.
