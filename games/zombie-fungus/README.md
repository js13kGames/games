This is a game which involves evading flying orange orbs that represent fungal spores while killing zombies. Movement is controlled using the arrow keys and attack is done with the space bar.

This game is unfinished in multiple ways. There is only one level, no audio, and no additional obstacles are present other than the need to evade the orbs.
