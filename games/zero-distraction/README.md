About one month ago this competition started and only two days before the deadline I started working on my game.. I might have been distracted.

This game is called Zero Distraction. Go offline and focus to complete the tasks!

It's about 7kb in total and it uses Phenomenon, a 2kb WebGL library I made earlier this year. Have fun and let me know what you think! 

Oh, and there's a surprise at the end. :)
