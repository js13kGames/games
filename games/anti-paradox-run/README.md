In this game the time is flowing backwards, you are constantly running, and have to avoid creating paradoxes (that cause CHAOS).

To do that, catch your bullets (which you've shot "before"), avoid enemies' bullets (which you've avoided "before"), and avoid falling into the abyss.

Moving: use up / down keys or tap upper / lower halves of the screen.
