Do you ever feel unpleasant when travelling through crowded places? Now that Corona has entered our everyday lives, this has become even more of a struggle: "Stay away from everyone else as far as possible. Stay safe!"
You may think to yourself: "This sucks! I can't wait to get home so I can stop thinking about this whole Corona stuff."
So ... Why not bring the struggle home? With our fantastic game, you can relive your daily traumatic struggle of avoiding people and avoiding Corona!
Your objective: Stay away from everyone else as much as possible. Be careful: Q Anon people don't wear masks and therefore have a higher chance of infecting you. But don't worry: occasionally, you can pick up vaccines that will lower your likelihood of getting infected. Stay safe and keep your space!
