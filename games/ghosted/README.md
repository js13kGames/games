**Ghosted** is a Sokoban-type puzzle game where you play as a naked alien humanoid who has exactly 13 steps to move until he transforms to a ghost. The goal is to collect all the coins in the map, but the twist is that they can be only collected when you are a ghost, but as a ghost you cannot push rocks or press buttons.

The game has 12 levels and one hidden one you unlock by beating all the other levels.

## Controls:
- **Arrow keys**: move
- <kbd>R</kbd>: Restart level
- <kbd>Backspace</kbd> or <kbd>Z</kbd>: Undo a move
- <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Esc</kbd>: Open a pause menu

## !!! IMPORTANT !!!

1. Use Firefox or Chrome/Edge to get the audio working properly. Apparently does not work on Brave browser and most likely not on Safari, either.

2. The graphics do not show properly if played in the private mode on Firefox (some noise pixels might appear). On regular mode works fine. The reason for this is unknown.
