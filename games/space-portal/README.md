You are stuck in an alien spaceship! Your only hope of escaping is finding all 3 energy orbs. Thanks to alien technology, you can create portals out of thin air.

No canvases are used in the game, the rendering is done using only 3D CSS :-)

Controls: standard fps controls, move with WASD, look around with using mouse
