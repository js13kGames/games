Imagine Wordle, but for Math Geeks ðŸ¤“ (but don't worry if you're not)

And now try to guess all the years of the 13th century with the provided clues.

You start with a "blind" guess and then will be given clues based on the fun mathematical properties your guess shares with the secret number.

These properties are:
- even/odd
- prime factors
- sum of digits
- (more to come in future versions ðŸ˜‰)

Each round will be a new random number in that range. And you can collect stars based on your performance.

Don't know where to start or how to continue? Check out the cheat sheet.
