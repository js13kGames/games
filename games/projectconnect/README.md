In project connect, drones have stolen the internet. It’s up to you in your hover car to go and get it back! First you’ll need to find the ethernet chord and then plug it into the port. BUT WATCH OUT! The drones are on to you and you will need to avoid them or they will destroy your car! Your car is great, however, it’s a BATTERY HOG! There are charged batteries scattered through the levels that are meant for the drones but they will fit in your car to grab them if you can! If you get all of then in an area you’ll even get an extra life!
