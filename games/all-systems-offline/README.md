You have to leave Earth with a damaged spaceship immediately! Control systems are almost offline, so you have to avoid planets manually by using the effect of their gravity field. These four items will help you on your way, try to pick them up: fuel (to use the nozzle system), plasma (to destroy planets), beam (to pick up items in a radius), and money (to upgrade items).

It is an endless game with the challenge of breaking your own record. Fly as far as you can.





Little cheat for getting some extra money: triple click on the yellow circle in the "Story / Controls" menu. ðŸ˜‰
