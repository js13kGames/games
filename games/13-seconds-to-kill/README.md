While exploring an ancient underground labyrinth, intrepid adventurer T'reze found a sword. As he wielded it, it clung to the young man's hand and a sinister voice echoed in his mind: "I am XIII and the more souls you sacrifice to feed me, the more power I will give you. This sword represents my appetite and if it's fire goes out, I will be hungry and I will take your soul." The power granted by XIII pleased the adventurer for a while, but the deaths he was forced to cause began to take a toll on his sanity. Now, T'reze goes to the lair of Dreizehn, the wicked necromancer who created the cursed sword, whose soul is the only thing that can satiate XIII forever. The risk, however, is great: while inside the necromancer's tower, the artifact's hunger will be even more brutal.
