Space no longer sounds its old self... Bring harmony to the Cosmic Microwave Background by solving each planet's musical puzzle!

How to play:
------------
Each planet has an iconic space tune. Each ring of the planet is a note of the tune. Unfortunately, each tune was scrambled. Recompose the tune by swapping rings 2 by 2.

Wider rings mean longer notes. Colder ring colors mean lower notes, while warmer ring colors mean higher notes. A hint will help you guess the tune of each planet.

Controls:
---------
Drag and drop ring with mouse clicks (desktop) or tap (mobile). Rings will light up when they can be dropped.

Web Monetization:
-----------------
Coil subscribers get exclusive markers under each ring indicating if notes are correctly placed or not.
