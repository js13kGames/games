An unfinished vertical shoot 'em up.

Pretty much feature complete in terms of systems, but ended up only having time to create a single level, and not much playtesting, so i'm not sure how fun it is.

Controls are arrow keys / WASD for moving, and space to shoot.

Only 8.3k, so plenty of room for adding more content.
