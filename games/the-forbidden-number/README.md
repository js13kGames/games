The game features an 8x5 grid of numbers that are randomly blurred, with the level of blurring increasing as the player progresses. The goal is to click on the numbers, but the player must avoid clicking on the number 13. When a player clicks a number, time is added to their time bar. The game ends when the time bar is completely full.

Game uses mouse as control, and numbers are selected by clicking right mouse button.

I started this project initially with Kontra.js, but I decided to switch to DIY "engine". I am not sure was this good decision, but I use Kontra.js next time. :)
