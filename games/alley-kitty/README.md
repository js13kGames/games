# Alley Kitty

## Controls

[W-A-S-D] [Cursor keys] - move

[Space] - jump

## Hints

Jump through a window to enter a room.

**The Broom** will try to kick you out, but more importantly, it wants the room to be clean - leave footprints to keep it busy. 

**The cat in the trash** will pop up sometime, it might push you off the bin.

**The dog** will sniff around from time-to time - try to avoid it.

**The canary** tastes good, just like **mice** and **fish**.

**The eel** just wants a hug, but that hurts.

**The vases** are fragile.
