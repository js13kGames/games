Destroy all the castles with a cannonball in the fewest number of shots! Use the mouse to aim and click to shoot. Once you're moving, hold down the mouse to turn the ball back into a cannon, and release to shoot again.

The game is pretty short, but you can try and go back and birdie every hole if you get to the end and are looking for a more difficult challenge.
