"Glitched 15" is supposed to be a classic sliding puzzle. But because of lack of time the developer has left a few unfixed bugs. That causes glitches from time to time. You'll see :-)

Your goal is to reposition the tiles in ascending order from 1 (the top left corner) to 15 counting left to right. The hole has to be in the bottom right corner.

You can move the tiles in the following ways:
- using the arrow keys. This moves just one tile.
- using WASD. That moves the whole row/column.
- by clicking an appropriate tile.

To see the help and then get back to the game use ESC. To reset the game use SPACE.

Have fun and good luck! The clock is ticking!
