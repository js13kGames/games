The game is not complete, however the game mechanics is working and this attempt recovers the old school of HTML + CSS display with a good FPS.

You will get the story intro and a chance to fight against "They", the enemy people. The intention was to construct a real story to criticize the war, however, without time and story, it looks like a "war  ode".

Far away from my previews entries this is a "point and click" shot game.
