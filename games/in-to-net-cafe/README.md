You are the server in an Internet Cafe.
Move with WASD or Arrows and Mouse to click, use the build menu to place a desk, chair and then a PC onto the desk and you are off!

Press spacebar to quick select the data gun and fire data at users who are waiting, score points that can be spend on new items.

Servers generate data which you collect, auto data turrets help deliver data, vending machines earn you extra money.

You will need to save for upgrades for shooting speed, auto ammo collection, more ammo per server and finally rating upgrades.

Missed data for users result in a penalty to your rating, your money and the number of current users.
