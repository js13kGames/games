Explore the caves and get the gold.

I wanted to create the game where different materials (rock, dirt, lava, water, ice and oil) react with each other and create something new so you can create interesting puzzles to solve.

Unfortunately there are only two levels, first one is kinda tutorial like, and the second one shows some (not all:<) of the mechanics. I couldn't fit more, but it was fun to make:)

It is Google Chrome only game.
