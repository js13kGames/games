Two pads, one ball, four lives, and lots of bricks to destroy. Obviously, there's a catch: you know the world is round, don't you ?

Either go through the 13 levels with patience and elite aiming skills, or cheat your way to the end screen. Did I mention a cheat ? Oops ...

Controls :
for keyboard owners : left/right arrows to move pad, Enter or space to launch the ball, Escape for ingame menu.

for both : left and right can be switched by setting the controls to "goofy" in the menu.
