Alive and Loaded is a multiplayer exploration and escape game.
Players will need to cooperate to access the temple's treasures, but unlocking those chambers will infuriate the ancient gods.
Fear their wrath as the walls and ceiling begin to collapse. 
Not all explorers will survive, and only the richest will win.
Will you stay trapped forever in the depths of the temple, or can you make it back outside, alive .. and loaded ?

Controls : simple point and click. The game starts once three adventurers are in front of the entrance door.
