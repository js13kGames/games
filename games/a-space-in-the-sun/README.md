A turn based strategy game about growing vines is a broken courtyard in the sun. You control how the tiles are cracked to help your plant dominate the space in the sun.
The game has a tutorial to teach the rules as well as four courtyard sizes to play on for different flavoured games.
You can play against the AI (4 different AI's with different skills and playing styles); against another human opponent on the same device; or against another human opponent across the internet.
Have fun - grow well.
