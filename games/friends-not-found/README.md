::FRIENDS NOT FOUND::

==Description==
In an unknown millennia, a single computer with a simple AI was found deep within a government facility. You, the player, switch it on, only to find a simple puzzle game made by the AI. In this game, the player must align the grid tiles with the goals on the left, in order to reach the target score for each level. Along with your helpful AI companion, what will your highscore be?

A short game, localized only in Japanese (English was extra bytes!). Inspired by Borderlands 3 Science minigame.

==Controls==
Mouse-only controls. Click the tiles to move them up one space. Click the UP ARROW tile to move back down. If a tile is in a matching row, then a point is awarded. When your target score >= score, you can click the green arrow to proceed.
