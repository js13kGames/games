A quick turn-based strategy game with element-based upgrades, good for a 15-minute lunch break session :). Fun to play against the AI, even more fun to play against your friends on a tablet!

Works on all modern browsers I could get my hands on, features WebAudio sound (where available), procedural map generation and a faux-3d presentation using CSS only. No external assets used other than JS.
