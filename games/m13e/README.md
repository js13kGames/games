M13E: Overcoming Triskaidekaphobia

Welcome to M13E, a compact yet thrilling game crafted for the js13kGames 2024 competition! This year's theme, Triskaidekaphobia (the fear of the number 13), inspired me to create a maze game with a unique twist.
Game Overview

Each level gives you 13 seconds to:

    Find the exit before time runs out.
    Collect coins scattered throughout the maze.
    Avoid dangerous traps like lava and obstacles.
    Utilize portals to walk through walls as the difficulty ramps up.

The further you go, the more coins and obstacles you’ll face, but you’ll always be racing against that 13-second timer.
