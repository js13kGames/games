It is web implementation of Ludo.I have used simple html,css and vanilla js for developing this game.The layout is made using div element(not using canvas).Just enter the number of players then press  `R` for rolling the dice and numpad keys 1-4 for moving different token(!plz check num-lock) and `P` for passing to the next player.
