One of the best offline games one can pick up is the Rubik's Cube, arguably the most iconic puzzle of all time.
Many beautiful variants of the twisty puzzle can be created, & this game contains exactly that.
You are given 9 such puzzles of varying difficulty level - each built on the structure of 3 of the platonic solids.
Can you solve them all? Even better, can you master the general strategy that conquers all such puzzles?
Good luck!
