As the shuttle launches, you can feel your ship exploding behind you. You and your crew are safe, but set adrift in space.

This game is all about rolling dice, managing risk, and allocating the resources available to you.

Keep you hull intact, power up the shuttle, and renew your dwindling oxygen supply.

When you shuttle has enough power, boost the strength of your distress signal in order help guide nearby ships to you. Without a full strength signal, other ships will never find you.

The game is entirely mouse / touch controls.

Drag crew members to tasks to begin them, and try to meet the tasks dice requirements. Keep in mind you can hold onto a dice for another harder task if things are looking bad.

Bonus for coil subscribers:
- You can choose to start with 1 crew member at level 2.
- This doesn't put you at a very big advantage, as it means a harder task has a chance to spawn right off the bat as well.
- This can be disabled on the main menu.
