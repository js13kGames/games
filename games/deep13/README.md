You are in a submarine in the depths of the Artic circle.

Your vessel is investigating a strange signal emanating from deep the water surface.

We have launch a flare to mark the entry spot.

Submerge in the frozen waters to find the source of the signal, but remember, your submarine cannot stand more than 13 atmospheres of pressure. Also, something is moving down there, be careful.

Keys:

WSAD to control the vessel

QE to control the up and down tank

F toggle light

1: toggle sonar

2: toggle scanner

G: fix leaks

Space: brake


Disclaimer: The collision engine is a little simple so sometimes you could get stuck in the map without any way to escape. If that happends, sorry :/
