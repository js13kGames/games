Hey, does everybody know the Pig game? No? Take a look at the Wikipedia article then. "Gip Desrever" defers from the classic Pig game in that:
- you spin the wheel not roll the dice
- you play with bot named "Gip"
- this year theme is "Reversed" so this game is reversed: you don't collect points  - you steal them from Gip. And Gip will steal from you. The goal is to clean out Gip totally. 

"Gip Desrever" stands for Reversed Pig in either French or Chinese, I forgot.
