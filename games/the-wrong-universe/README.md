You’re lost.  Not in the woods, or on a desert island or even in a good book.
Am I lost in Space you wonder?
Well.. yes, you are. But it’s not the space you’ve grown up to know.  Buck Rodgers or Ripley can’t help you.  You see, you’re lost in another universe with no way home.  You and your mate Dave pinched a dimension transporter thing, but you weren’t bright enough to pinch sufficient fuel for your trip home.  Now Dave’s been eaten by a space lizard, leaving just you and a small fighter ship. Oh you are going to die, but how many wrong-dimension aliens can you take with you?
