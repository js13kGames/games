Description:
"Big Movie Hacker" is a collection of mini-games. There is a time limit for each screen (the green border line). The difficulty of each task changes as you succeed / fail, and as you progress through levels.

Controls:
You play with a mouse (or touch screen).

Web Monetization:
Extra games are unlocked if you have a Coil account / web monetization.

My favorite parts are the voices, explosions & the monkey faces :)
