A tranquil and aesthetically pleasing search for a long lost memory.

A moment lost in time is an exploration game with an element of a geometry puzzle. The goal of the game is to memorize and then find a shot of a landscape taken from a random place.
The game offers a slowly-paced gameplay combined with minimalist and aesthetically pleasing visuals and simple ambient sounds. It evokes a sense of wandering and longing. The art direction is abstract and figurative: as if it was a dream.
