I found about the game jam halfway into the actual game jam like a half of the time had already elapsed. Then I procrastinate for a couple more days. And finally on the last day. I started to make the game. This is the first time I’ve ever made a game and I’ve ever used JavaScript.



I just thought the idea of the actual puzzle. Being a QR code. That works was really cool

So I tried to make that 
I’m a total beginner


I don’t really understand how to get the QR code to work, but the game works..... i hope
