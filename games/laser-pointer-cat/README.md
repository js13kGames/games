This is an unfinished demo for the WebXR category. It's meant to be played in VR, but there are non-VR controls left in for testing purposes.

You're in a garden with Badlucky, who gets easily distracted by shiny laser pointer lights. You can shine a light with both controllers in VR, and Badlucky will start chasing it around. You can also move and turn with the joysticks.

There is no core gameplay loop or goal, but it's a showcase of what you can do with PlayCanvas.
