A-Snake is a twist on the classic "snake" games of yore.

Guide your snake around a virtual environment to help it find its lost body parts. Running into ("gobbling") a body part will add it back to A-Snake's tail end. Find as many as you can without running into yourself or the walls.

A/Left-Arrow to turn left, D/Right-Arrow to turn right. Mouse drag to look.

Good luck!
