You have lost your sight, but gained the power of echolocating. When you start, you will not be able to see the level. By pressing SPACE you can temporarily reveal the space around you.

When you know where to go, use the WASD/ZQSD/Arrow keys to move and jump around.

To advance to the next level, you need to reach the flag. There are also coins to be found, which you can reveal with your echo.

If you want something really hard, try the Memorizer game mode. You will get a single echo at the start of the level. After that you need to traverse the level from memory. If you die, you will get a new echo.

--------------------

Due to personal stuff, I didn't have much time to work on the game. The mechanics are working and there are a few levels and two game modes, but I would like to add more levels, sounds and better graphics in the future.

I'm mostly interested in any feedback you may have about the mechanics of the game.
