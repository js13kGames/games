You are a merchant who has to sell goods to the people (and crabs) of the village.

Use your mouse to interact with the world. 
Drag and Drop items near the store to sell them.

Read more about possible interactions by clicking on signs.

You have a short life, so you have to sell as much as possible in 7 minutes.

**Tip**: Prepare more goods in your yard in advance. Hire cyclops for help, they are not smart, but an extra pair of hands is never a bad thing.
