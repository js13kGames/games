A simple game made from only 9 colors :D (Or at least it started as only 9 colors, but had to include white, for the text).

The more you kill the more monsters and clouds are going to spawn.
 - Starting with a spawn chance of 10:1 (per sec), and each kill it gets higher (9 kills = 2:1)

Controls:
 W/Up Arrow - Jump/Fly
 S/Down Arrow - Crouch
 A/Left Arrow - Left
 D/Right Arrow - Right
