Create sculptures from a model as fast as possible. After reaching 100%, try to do it without making mistakes. Share screenshots of your scoreboard to show off your achievements.

Controls - Highly recommend a VR headset and motion tracked controllers. Developed on Oculus Quest. Arrow keys/mouse will work in a pinch.
