LOSSST is back!
Better graphics, better controls, better music and a ton of new puzzles, mechanics and surprises!

Controls:
- Desktop: arrows/WASD/ZQSD to move, mouse to rotate the camera (and X/C to move vertically in the last world)
- Mobile: buttons to move, finger to rotate the camera.
- WebMonetization bonus: a puzzle editor!
- Decentralized challenges: NEAR (e-shop), Protocol Labs (Leaderboards), Flux (Skin editor).
- OCD challenges: beat the developer's scores for each puzzle, Hard Mode (New Game +)

Thanks to Bence for the SVG patterns, Yurume for RoadRoller, Anders Kaare for the sound effects, End3r for this amazing competition, Jaburns, Adrien, Julien, Anouk, Sam and Damien for the beta-testing! <3
