Come with me, back to the early '80s - coming home from school to try and grab a few hours with my Vic20 before my Dad came home and I lost the TV. I'd like to help you experience what it was like back then as we play a remake of my favourite Vic20 game - AstroBlitz - combined with a classic 80's movie - Firefox.

I've attempted to stay within the original constraints of the Vic20, using just the 8 colour palette, limited screen size, rectangular pixels and sprites of max 3 colours and double-width pixels.

Controls are WASD or arrows, with Space to fire. There's five levels to clear to win the game. There's no sound as I thought silence would be preferable to my attempts in this area!
