You are the Necrotic Commander! An ancient master of death and decay, with the power to reanimate the dead to do your bidding.

Despite your warnings, the local peasantry seek to dethrone you. Using your dark arts, destroy their pitiful uprising, and send them to their graves!

Spells;
1) Nether Bolt - Throw a flaming orb of dark energy. Be careful of friendly fire!
2) Drain Soul - Select a single peasant to absorb their life-force. This replenishes your mana, while slowly killing them.
3) Raise Dead - Bring a resting corpse back to life to fight for you by selecting a gravestone.
4) Corpse Bomb - Select a resurrected zombie to turn into a shambling bomb. The explosion damages everything in a radius around the target zombie.
