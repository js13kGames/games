The Elementary Challenges consist in four mini-games, each one devoted to one of the classical elements. You have a total of 4:04 to complete them all. WebMonetization users get the chance to retry one of games if they took too long.

Details, including the controls for the games, are inside the game.

It is definitely possible to win the game both in easy and normal mode, both on desktop and mobile, even though the latter is a bit harder. And just in case you find the last Water puzzle in normal mode too hard: You can find the solution in "Amusements in Mathematics" by Henry Ernest Dudeney.
