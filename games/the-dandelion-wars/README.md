Mysterious aliens, waves of attacks, weaponized dandelions: you name it, this game's got it.

WebXR only game. **Microphone permissions are essential and used to determine if you're blowing hard enough.**

Pick up a dandelion with the trigger button on controllers (hands work, but weren't tested), hold it, pick a target and blow. Blow! If you blow hard enough the seeds will launch.

**Beware the dandelions with 13 seeds!**

Tested on Quest Pro.
