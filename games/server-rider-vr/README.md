Server Rider VR is a short rhytm based VR game in which you are surfing through tubes in cyberspace while trying to keep the connection alive by aiming your controllers at the red and blue lanes.

The game has been successfully tested with Oculus Quest (latest update) and with HTC Vive in Chrome. You need two controllers to play the game (no gaze pointer, sorry).

The music has been heavily edited to play in my tiny music player which I call tinysequencer.js (Inspired by TinyMusic).
