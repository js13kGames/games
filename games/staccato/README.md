Staccato is a 1 or 2 player split-screen fast-paced racing game, originally inspired by Supercars on Amiga.
Default controls are WASD for player 1, arrow keys for player 2, F1 and Page Down to change the camera. Keys can be modified through the menu.

You car is a RWD, so it oversteers. A lot. You have been warned.
CPU players have the same car as yours and are not cheating, so if you cannot beat them, blame the pilot !

Breathalyzer test is not provided, but we trust you not to drink and drive.

Recommended use of Chroime or FF23+ (sfx uses WebAudio).
