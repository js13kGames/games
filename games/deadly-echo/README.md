Listen to emojis and echo them with the buttons before the slots run out! Or practice without pressure. 

Play the predefined games or customize your own.

Notes: 
* sound encouraged and even required for a big part
* if you have issues displaying most emojis, try the nostalgia set 
* on some systems the flags won't be properly displayed (especially Windows)
* in general, if you have any emoji issues, you can always configure your own game

If I had more time, I would: 
* make the score/star system more mature
* improve the language/voice selection
