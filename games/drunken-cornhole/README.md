## Cornhole is hard enough, but you are a drunken player with wobbly balance!

Compete against the CPU to reach 21 points first to win the match.

[tournament rules](//playcornhole.org/pages/rules) are used, and the boards conform to the standard tournament configuration.

## Cancellation Scoring
"Innings," like in baseball, have a top and bottom, with each team/player taking a turn. At the end of each inning the team/player with more points in the inning subtracts the other players points if any from their own, keeping any remaining points.

Bags thrown into the hole are worth 3 points each. Bags that land atop the box are worth 1 point each.

## Goal
First team/player to reach 21 points total wins the game.

## Note
Per official rules, if a bag bounces or touches the ground, its points are voided.
