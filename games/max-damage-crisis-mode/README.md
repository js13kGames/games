GAMEPLAY:
Land on three or more enemies of the same color to trigger your planted bombs. Detonate the bombs either by landing on an enemy of a different color, or by jumping back to your satellite platform.

CONTROLS:
Use the mouse to aim and jump, or simply tap the screen where you want to jump.


DESCRIPTION:
Inundated by extra-terrestrial forces, the last hope separating Earth from total destruction is a man named Max, and his preternatural ability to jump and to destroy things of a similar color. His vertical leap is beyond comprehension. His bombing skill are first class. Are you a bad enough dude to jump all the way from earth to the alien's planet to stop the invasion?
