## How to play

You have 13 days to score as many points as you can with your magic dice.  

Each time you roll, one of 3 things can happen:
- Land on a number - you earn that many points
- Land on a charm (star) - you earn that many charms
- Land on a cat - that die is cursed, and can't be re-rolled for the rest of the day

You may re-roll as many times as you like for more points and charms, but beware! 
If you curse all your dice, you will lose all your profits and end the day with nothing.

At the start of each day, you can spend your charms to upgrade your dice. Click any die to see a list of its faces, as well as after it is upgraded.

Good luck, and spend your charms wisely!

## Controls

Use your mouse or touch screen to play.

Alternatively, use the following keys:

- Space bar to roll
- Enter to end the day
- M to toggle mute (between sound and music, sound only, and no sound)
