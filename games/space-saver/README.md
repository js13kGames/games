You work for the SPACE-Y company! Every day is a glorious day to serve. Your wonderful job is to clear the landing spot of all the Trash. Clear the SPACE so new ships can land and spend their tourist dollars at the many SPACE-Y shops and hotels.

Push the trash into the compactor with the WASD, Arrow Keys, or Gamepad.

Trash is heavy! You can not push more than one block at a time.

Running the compactor is expensive! The more trash you fit into the compactor, the higher your score.
