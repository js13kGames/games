Balance is a game about trying to walk a tightrope (or slackline?) without falling off.

Tap/hold to move forward on mobile, use the space bar on desktop. You can only move forward so take your time.

If you try to move when the rope is at it's highest or lowest point you will wobble. Wobble three times in one level and you will fall.
If you touch any of the obstacles you will also fall.

If you're on mobile, I recommend landscape mode.

Try not to fall off(the)line.
