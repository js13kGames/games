A first person shooter.  I used the very good tutorials from https://webglfundamentals.org/ and https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API/Tutorial/Getting_star... to help me with the maths stuff I dont understand.

The aim of the game game is to eliminate all the hostile robots and rescue all the hostages.

The keys are:

left: A

right: D

forward: W

backward: S

rotate: LEFT/RIGHT ARROW keys

fire: UP ARROW key

run: LEFT SHIFT
