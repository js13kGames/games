You're the Tourist, geographically and culturally lost in Paris, trying to cross iconic monuments off your bucket list before your tour bus departs for the next European capital.

The game is unfinished (missing is all the character and city pixelart, as well as asking directions to locals) so it relies on programmatic placeholder art.

Featuring:
- crappy procedural levels
- randomly coloured squares
- blinking squares (seizure alert)
- brutal gameplay relying on visual memory and tons of luck
