This game tries to demonstrate what stationary punching would be like in a gritty 2d world. By unitizing the "A" and "D" button the very fabric of reality awaits your command...until the polarity is REVERSED! "D" is "A" and "A" is "D",. mother of god what is happening?! Enemies continue with their unending assault, but you the hero must stay focused and punch on! Good luck and may the darkness stay at bay.
