So you've _found_ yourself _lost_ in a maze with chickens running rampant?! Find your way to the exit and see what challenges await you in the next room.

Use your computer arrow keys (or `WASD`) to navigate. Push objects around to make a path for yourself. If you have ended up in a position that is impossible to get out of, hit `R` to reset the level.

And oh, be afraid of the small room with the 13 chickens! It looks impossible to escape, but you can get out unscathed if you are quick enough.
## Naming
Niwatori (鶏) is the Japanese word for "chicken" (the animal, not
poultry). I named my game using a Japanese word to pay homage to a game called Sokoban (倉庫番), which originates from Japan and plays similarly to Niwatori.
## Inspiration
A game I made in college for a game development project course inspired Niwatori. I was unfamiliar with Sokoban until I started building Niwatori for js13k 2024. Perhaps I played a game as a child inspired by Sokoban, which inspired my college game and now Niwatori.
