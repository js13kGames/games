I'm thinking of a simple strategy game and the SPACEBAR as the main control. 13 AD is a strategy game that requires serious thinking to win the game.
The game is displayed in hex-tile format and each tile has a different effect. Players must form a colony, assemble an army, defend or attack the enemy. The game will be over if one is defeated.

Game Control: SPACE and ARROW KEYS
