### MIDNIGHT PAWS 
by **Frost Sun**

It is almost midnight, and the darkness is deepening.

Find the **mouse holes** that lead to the next backyards.

Be quiet and hide in the bushes - or **the black cat** will catch you!

### Controls
Use **arrow keys** or **WASD** to move.

### Tips

- Watch the fence â€” if the cat appears on top, it's about to leap and target the mouse!
- Stay under a bush to make the cat lose interest in chasing you.
