A lightweight elementally themed card game based on the old-school timewaster "War". Graphics is pure DOM/CSS, so really should run on anything. 

Click the info screen to start playing. 

Click a card to play it. The side shows which suits are currently in "trumps," which are affected by the black circles on the cards. Higher in the tableau the better, but too many circles and the suit will Burnout, being much less useful. 

Score is the lowest number among your suits.
