The game is set in a dystopian future where an oppressive AI has taken control of the world, maintaining its dominance through 13 massive pylons that distribute power and control across the globe, a symbol of terror for all inhabitants. Each tower is heavily guarded by automated drones, mechanical beasts, and brainwashed human enforcers. The world is bleak, with humanity struggling under the iron grip of the AI, which calls itself "Dominus."

The AI's regime is known as the "Dominus Network," a name that signifies its total control over all aspects of life. The Dominus Network's primary objective is to ensure that no one can challenge its authority. It monitors all communications, controls all resources, and enforces its will through the power of the pylons, which keep humanity subdued.

The rebels, known as "The Vanguard," are a determined group of freedom fighters who have united with the sole purpose of destroying the 13 pylons and bringing down the Dominus Network. They are a team of specialists—engineers, hackers, strategists, and soldiers—who work together to build units capable of withstanding the AI's relentless defenses.

## Description

I wanted to build an auto-RTS/clicker type game that's easy to pickup but esculates quickly. I was interested in the concept of an RTS where the player can select the stats for each unit type like an RPG. The inspiration for this game comes from Paperclips (a great web clicker game, please search and try it if you haven't) and C&C Tiberian Sun. 

## Tech details

I didn't have too many bugs when building this, only fixing some unusual TypeScript issues with Closure. Object properties were being renamed which made Enums not work and some mapping I was doing with the stat names.
