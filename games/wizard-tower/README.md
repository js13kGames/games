Wizard Tower is a Rogue/Pac-like.  There are two play modes, R mode, and P mode.  You must light all the floor tiles to advance to the next level.  You can charge your wand by collecting energy spheres, and use them to vanquish the ghosts that haunt the tower.  If you press the centre button, you will shoot energy in a line forward.  If you have charges when hit by a ghost, one will be used to destroy any in a close proximity to you.  The goal is to achieve the highest score.  Good luck, and thanks for playing.
