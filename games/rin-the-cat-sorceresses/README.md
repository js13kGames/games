# Prologue
Rin was once one of the 13th century\' s most powerful sorceresses. Cursed by the Cat Witch Cauchy during a mission, she became a black cat of misfortune and was locked in Cauchy\' s basement.

But Rin\' s magic was strong. She broke the curse, mastering the cat\' s bad luck. Now she can shift between human and cat forms, using the black cat\' s misfortune to turn enemies\' attacks back on them.

Now, you must guide Rin. Help her escape Cauchy\' s basement and defeat the evil Cat Witch.
