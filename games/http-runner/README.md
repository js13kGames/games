You play as an HTTP request and you must find all the 5 files in each stage to progress. However, you must not get caught by the firewall agent, which has
gone haywire and is targetting innocent requests such as yourself.

Objective: Get all the files and get to the exit to go to the next stage. Clear all 5 stages to win.

Controls: WASD keys or arrow keys to move.
