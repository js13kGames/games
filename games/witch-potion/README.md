## Introduction

You have been visited by a magical creature: the Black Cat.  This creature bestows upon  you the power of witchood and with it the ability to cast magical spells and mix fantastic potions.

But the Black Cat is a fickle creature, and should you act out of accordance with what the cat believes to be a proper witch, then you will lose favor.  Should you lose too much, you risk the removal of your new-found powers.


## Description

Witch Potion is an event-based dice game where you mix potions, cast spells, solve problems, and ultimately try to convince the Black Cat that you are worthy of your powers.

The controls are simple: click or tap the buttons to make choices when you are prompted.

Enjoy, and know that if you fail,  you can always retry.


## Tips

- Mitigate risk by brewing Liquid Luck.  These potions allow you to always pass a dice check, provided you have enough dice.
- If you are finding you don't have enough herbs, use a Growth Potion to all but guarantee yields.
- Specialpetal is expensive and hard to get.  You should pounce on the opportunity to get it cheaply.
