This is an adventure game written with SVG, JavaScript, CSS and bundled with Rollup.

The game comes with some controls (which are hopefully reachable).

I couldn't complete it, though. Here's what was planned to do:

You enter a world of distrust. Different communities depend on each other, but lost faith. They went different paths.
It's your job to earn their trust and make them join the octagon table.

But hurry up! After 7 days, everything faded to gray and you'll loose.

A day in the game will take about 6 minutes.
