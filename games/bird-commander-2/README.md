Relive Alfred Hitchcock's movie The Birds through the avian eyes of Commander Bird, leader of the fiercest squadron of angry fowl. Your goal is to eliminate as many humans as possible.

Before attacking, strategically place your flocks of birds. Then, when the humans least expect it, attack! Move your flocks to eliminate your targets before they can reach safety.

Eliminating more than 50% of your targets will get you to the next stage.

Good luck, Commander!
