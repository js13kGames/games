Cheats are: click item in store to get 100 of it. And move or zoome camera with mouse, excapt for the first week.

Terra Mobilis is an experimental game. It is alike to Civilization, but is set on the planet with ever-changing geography. Local nature (including people) has had to adapt, living constantly on the move. People have learned to get by with minimal amount of things with flexible usage. So, a wagon can be used as a ship (with a help of some fabric as the sail), engine can be taken from the car and used in the factory, etc.

You can do one of three things here. 
Move from the location to location using map. 
Use one of the recipes on the right to craft things, collect things from location, or choose the travel method. 
The last one is picking the research focus ⚗️ once you have the respective  tech - it accelerates the book effect on the research of the respective tech. 
Each action takes time, even focus switching.

The more stuff you have in store, the harder it will be to move around, and some percentage will be lost each week. On the other hand, just by having thing (or being on location with them) you make people happier (attracting more of them) and advance the research on relevant topic (check top right of the recipe buttons for what's "relative", and books📙 accelerate all research)

Year on the planet has 13 months. On the last month of year, and also throughout each 13th years, various "calamities" 👹☣️🌋 appear.  Remove them to reclaim space for the more useful location (as the total number of spots is limited).

"Tool" type resources (🛠️ tools,⛺ housing,🛷 wagons,🐴 horses,⚙️ engines and 🏹 weapons) are expended only at 10% of the listed at recipe rate, but travel requires full horse etc. per each unit of weight. Each pop👨‍👩‍👦‍👦 weight 0.5🏋, and each resource - 0.05🏋

Recipes with 🐾 and 🍃can work differently  with different resources.
