Offline Race is an online game where you have to defeat to your rival in a race to get connection.

You have to move your ethernet wire selecting numbers between 0 and 9 to sum quantities between 10 and 30.
The first player that arrive to the end line win.
If no one get the quantity in 30 seconds it will change to another

To play in a desktop device use mouse to select numbers, "enter key" to validate the sum and "supr key" to clear the current path.

To play in a touch device use a simple touch to select the numbers and a drag gesture to the right to send your sum, and a drag to the left to clear the current path.

Good luck
