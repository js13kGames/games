A scrolling shooter in the vein of "Raptor: Call of the Shadows" and "Warning Forever". Are you able to survive 13 waves? Press X to fire, F for fullscreen, M to switch to the original ship model from our full-featured "Starship Sorades" game (yes, I had 3 KB left and wasted them for an easter egg). Multiple control schemes provided, e.g. cursor keys, WASD and numpad.

I use a lot of pre-rendering and other tricks to make this run as fast as possible on a wide variety of browsers and machines. Developed with Opera. Tested with Firefox, Chrome and even Internet Explorer 9 (no sound though). Fullscreen works in Opera 12.50+, Firefox and WebKit based browsers.
