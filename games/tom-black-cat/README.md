Tom Black Cat!

You control a black cat and must collect as much food as possible in a limited time.
At the same time, you must avoid boxes so as not to stop.
If you collide with a box, you must blow up the box.
The cat's speed constantly decreases, especially when colliding with boxes, 
but the cat's speed increases if you pick up food.

Keyboard control: move-up/down arrows,space-explosion/start
Touchscreen control: controller(bottom right).

Good luck!
