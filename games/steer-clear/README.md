Steer Clear is a game about navigating your tugboat and barge through tedious waters and delivering crates to factories along the way.

Controls:
Starting the game = Enter
Moving = WSAD
Unload crate at factory = Space

I'm looking forward to fleshing this game out more after the jam.  I've did various bits of work on Steer Clear for several years now, but it's a larger Phaser-based game.  I thought it might be fun to develop a quick, tiny version for the JS13K competition!
