A classic dungeon crawler for JS13k 2020 by Nicklas Löf

Graphics by Nicklas Löf and https://www.patreon.com/elthen/

Play with WASD and mouse.
Shift to pickup items
Q to drop items
E to eat
1-3 to switch inventory slots
F11 if you want to switch to full screen (with some borders to avoid scrollbars)

Hints:

If you get stuck early you might need to get rid of an item.
If you push a box into a corner hit it with the dagger to reset it.
Enimies and consumables respawns so you can always go back and grind for an upgraded weapon before fighting the end boss.

Theme: Implemented twice. First playfully in the title but also if you play the game longer than a few minutes there is another implementation of the theme

Libraries: All code done by myself using WebGL except the matrix maths where I have used the relevant parts from the excellent gl-matrix javascript package: http://glmatrix.net/

Tools used: Visual studio code, Gimp and Paint.net
