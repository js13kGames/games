        Can you handle the teleportation manually until I find Greg?
      </p>
      <p>
        It seems that in every group teleportation, one of the clones is missing. You have to tell the pad which one is it. It's easy since the clones like to wear matching outfits.

      <p>
        Also, Greg always brags about his score. Knock it down. That will show
        him.<span>&#128170&#128513</span>

        Your performance is much better than that of our previous <em>employees</em>. And you adapted well, <em>you're even wearing the appropriate colors for the job</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, what do you say? Will you be handling the post from now on?
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh, come on &#128513. I'm sure you cannot say no. Isn't that right, <span class="white"><em>Greg</em></span>?
