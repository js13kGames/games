What I was thinking: It was going to have generated levels and be a race to kill the plants before the water sprite could save them, I was going to include recharge time for when you went through a puddle. I had fun messing around with the voice API... I know it's annoying it could use work too.

How it's unfinished: There is no gameplay designed yet, just a board with a player and an enemy moving around.

Why it's unfinished: I couldn't come up with a game idea that I was excited about (I thought the theme was too broad) so I settled on the death of plants by burning. I lost enthusiasm and stopped working on it.
