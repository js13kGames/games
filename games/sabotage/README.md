You're assigned to stealth mision - disable connection between 3 hostile campuses.

Main goal of each level is to access the antenna and hack it - then entire campus goes offline and sabotage is done. 
Main mechanics is to stay quiet and not detected by enemies patrolling campus. 
Use dark, shaded fields to stay undetectable, even if you're close to guard.

Superhot-like gameplay, so world is moving when player is moving or cleaning.
TIP: keep walking into wall or use P key to stay in one place while rest of world is moving.

Moving: WSAD. Player can kill enemy by knife using L key but just when enemy can't see player - for example when player attacks from behind or looks away. Range of knife is 1 tile in 4 directions. But be careful, killed enemy spreads blood which can be saw by other enemy! Do not let this happen and clean floor using P key.
