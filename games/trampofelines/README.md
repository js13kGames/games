The yarn balls are on the loose and elastic felines must soar high in the sky to rescue them!

Use the stretchy body of the *trampofelines* to bounce the yarn balls to the baskets.
The yarn balls unfurl in the air, getting progressively smaller until they're all thread. If the ball doesn't reach a basket soon enough it won't bounce anymore, so don't stall too long.

### Controls:
* draw a line by dragging your finger or pointer device across the screen to create a trampofeline.

### Rules:
* when three yarn balls go fully below the screen it's game over;
* you can draw up to three trampofelines at a time;
* trampofelines may not intersect;
* a trampofeline stores a lot of energy, so it dies as soon as it hits a yarn ball.

### Goal:
* fill up as many baskets as you can!
