Cardice is a roguelike deck building game.

Pick a hero to get a deck with special effects depending of your character class.

Find the best path the reach the boss and bring the princess Page back.

Drag and drop dice on cards to play their effects.


Cardice is a mix between Slay the Spire and Dicey dungeons!
