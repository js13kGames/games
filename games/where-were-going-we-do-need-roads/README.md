As a rally team navigator, you have *lost* the map! Improvise your way through uncharted wilderness, and beware of brick walls â€” the natural enemy of a race driver.

Alter the landscape by clicking (tapping) and dragging. Try to avoid crashing for as long as possible! (Yes, this is a Flappy Bird-esque game.)

Inspired by the work of @abagames much.
