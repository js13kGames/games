A quite simple air combat game.

Use the cursor keys to move, space to fire.
On a touch device, use one finger to move and two fingers to fire.

And here's the glitch: You may take a break from combat by escaping through the ground. If you hit the ground firing, you get to the "other side" where the world looks a bit differnt. Enemies cannot follow you there. But remember to keep that fire button pressed to stay alive on the other side.
