Welcome to "Castle Attack," an exciting medieval-themed game. In this game, your mission is to destroy chests strategically placed within various castle forts using a ballista. Here's how it works:

### Controls
- Use the arrow keys to adjust the angle of your ballista.
- Press the spacebar to launch projectiles from the ballista.

### Objective
In each level, you'll find three chests hidden within the castle walls. Your goal is to obliterate these chests. These chests contain the treasures of rival kings! By destroying them, you'll weaken your competitors and enhance your own wealth and power.

To advance to the next level, you must destroy at least one chest in the current level. Challenge yourself by aiming precisely and strategizing your shots, but remember, you have a limited supply of projectiles for each level. The number of projectiles and their types vary from level to level:

- **Boulder**: A standard, solid projectile.
- **Time bomb**: A projectile that detonates three seconds after being launched.
- **Impact bomb**: A projectile that detonates upon impact.

Choose your projectiles wisely and conquer each level to become the ultimate castle attacker! Best of luck in your medieval adventure!
