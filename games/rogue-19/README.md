Your planet is under attack from an alien civilization which is waging chemical warfare by sending viral pathogens through space toward you.

You are the first in a series of clone pilots sent to destroy the pathogens and the final boss, the Incubator!

Rogue-19 is a "rogue-like" 2D scrolling shooter. Your ship levels up upon death or completion of the game. Progress is saved to local storage.

When played in Landscape mode, it's a horizontal shooter; in Portrait mode, it's a vertical shooter. However, the game is best played in Landscape mode. It isn't fully optimized for Portrait mode yet.

I was hoping to improve the rendering and make the cells infectious upon proximity, but ran out of time, but there is a boss battle, at least!
