I am one of the js13k judges, so I voluntarily disqualify myself from the competition! However, I adore coding so much that I tried to make a little 13kb demo anyways - just for the love the gamedev!

It was a challenging month for various non computer reasons... and with that in mind, I am proud of what I had time to make!

An infinite city generator with silly tangled up roads, filled with 404 other cars on the road! The roads are created using quadratic spline curves, and I also use these, with a little math magic, to move the cars around!

All in 13kb, including a cool procgen engine sound loop!

What a fun game jam! I wish I had longer to tinker; I could go on forever with the dream of what I wish it had become. As a developer who is working on a 13GB game (!) adapting to these constraints was a joy. There's something refreshing about small projects. I just love them.

Thank you for a wonderful month! NOW I GET TO PLAY AL YOUR GAMES!!! WOOO HOOO!
