A tower defense game in which you can play either on life's or death's side.

There are some glitches in the submitted version, but life happened so I could not complete them.
However, fixes will appear on my own git repository and the one on GitHub is going to be archived. Check the About page in game for more.

Completely controllable by UI controls. Alternatively, keyboard and mouse resp. finger can be used.
