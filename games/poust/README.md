Run, jump, and shoot your way out of a collapsing planet. 

* Hitting a wall will reverse your direction. 
* The recoil from shooting can be used to slow you down or speed you up. 
* You can wall jump. 
* Hitting back in the browser will take you to the menu, refresh will restart the level
* Touch controls are context-sensitive, below will jump if you're on the ground, left/right will jump if you're on a wall, everywhere else shoots
* Supports Chrome, Firefox, Android. iOS doesn't have sound, but otherwise works
* If you have performance issues, try making the browser window smaller
