13 levels. 404 seconds. Can you complete them all before the time runs out?

Do you need help? Use the question mark button at the top right of each level to get a hint. There are multiple hints for each level. But don't click so quickly, because each hint will cost you 13 seconds!

Still stuck? Don't worry, after all the hints are used, you can spend 50 seconds to skip the level.

Have fun!
