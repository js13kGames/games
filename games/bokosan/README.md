This is your first night shift as a warehouse keeper in a rather strange warehouse. Your job is to pull back all the boxes that were restlessly pushed into the wrong places by your daytime colleagues in the past 30 years.

Keyboard controls: left-right-up-down moves, SHIFT to grab the box or select a menu item, ESC to go back.

Touch screen controls: swipe on the right side of the display to move, touch the lower left corner to grab the box or select a menu item, touch the top left corner to go back.
