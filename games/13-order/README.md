Welcome to "13 Order"!

In this number puzzle challenge, your goal is to arrange the numbers on grids of different sizes, from 3x3 up to 13x13 ðŸ¤¯. Each level presents a unique and increasingly complex puzzle that tests your logic and patience.

The real challenge is in the final level: the 13x13 grid! This level is one of the most difficult and will test all your skills. But donâ€™t worryâ€”if you get stuck, you can use the special button to find the solution for you, if one exists.

Are you ready to tackle these puzzles and conquer the final board?
