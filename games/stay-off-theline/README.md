The goal of the game is to stay offline (don't touch a line) for as long as possible. Lines will constantly move to the left and there is always a chance that a new line will spawn at the right side of the playfield. If you find yourself in a pinch, you can utilize a strong or a weak cut attack that, if it hits the start of a line kills the line. (if you have the charge for it) But be aware! Your shots travel really slowly and they can kill you, too. You will gain exponentially more score points and charge for your shots the further to the right you go.

Sadly I got pretty sick during development so I wasn't able to make the game as big as I wanted to. The game was originally supposed to have actual graphics, animation and sound but since I couldn't spend as much time on it as I wanted to it doesn't. I still wanted to submit the game because I did spend a lot of time coming up with it and it's kind of fun, actually.
