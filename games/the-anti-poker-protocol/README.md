A bit of a different take on poker!
Featuring CRT visuals, sprites/graphics generated in-game (no image textures at all!), mobile support, and some whacky NPCs which feature a stunning guaranteed (>1) amount of lines to bark at you.

Making a smart opponent which can play various hands proved too tricky in the end, so for my final entry I pivoted the game into a 'play the highest card' type of challenge. The opponents and game constraints *should* get a bit more difficult as you progress.

Mouse/Touch to play.
Mobile Supported!
When the game round starts, click the deck for an overload of information (game instructions)
*some bugs for sure 

Thankyou for testing & playing, I look forward to playing everyones games!

I didnt have time to add all the AVAX WEB3 features I had hoped in the end. But you will need to imagine - there *was* some NFT badges and progression until I tore the guts out of this trying to get it under 13k.
