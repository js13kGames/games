In this game, you don't control a skater...
You draw the skatepark!

The entry is inspired by Line Rider and named after an annagram of the theme.
The goal is to be creative... while keeping the skater on its skate as long as possible.
You can draw lines (fixed) and balls (mobile).
The balls become blue when the skater touches them.
The levels are shareable.

10 challenges are also available for the most fearless players!

Controls:
- mouse to edit the track
- keyboard and mouse wheel can also be used to move the camera
- right click can also be used to erase an item

Decentralized challenges:
- Arcadia (the game is also uploaded on arcadia.fun)
- OP Guild (since you only control the level, the skater is the ultimate NPC!)
