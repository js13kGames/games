Help Dot reach the goal in under 13 steps. It's measured in keystrokes, you have to be judicious about every movement.

- WASD, Arrows, Dpad: Walk/Ladder
- Space, Z, A(gamepad): Jump

If you complete all 13 levels, you'll be scored by total time and total keystrokes. No storage; remembering scores is up to you. Time spent standing on the goal doesn't count.

If you get stuck, just dance until you explode.
