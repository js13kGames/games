You and your fellow spacefarer are stranded and almost out of fuel! Luckily, you notice an abandoned space station nearby. But it's a pretty glitchy place... who knows what lies inside?

Find the shuttle in the space station, make sure it's powered up, and escape before you run out of oxygen. Avoid glitches and explosions if you can.

*** NOTES ***

This is a co-op game for two players! Each player should log on in a separate browser.

- Player 1 should select "new game", then send the game code (in the upper left corner) to player 2.
- Player 2 should select "join game" and enter their game code.

*** WHAT IF I'M HAVING TROUBLE CONNECTING SYSTEMS TOGETHER? ***

Once you're able to create wires, *both* players must go to each of the two systems simultaneously, as close as possible to the center of the word.
