In the 13th century, a tower under construction began to lean in the Republic of Pisa.
Restore the misaligned floors and save the tower from collapsing!

Touch the panels like a slide puzzle, and stack them according to the floor numbers.

You can go around the tower using the buttons on both sides of the screen.
