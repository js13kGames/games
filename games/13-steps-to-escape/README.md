13 Steps to Escape is a 2D pixel art puzzle game.

Every level you have to reach the flag. You can push crates, pick keys to open locks, trigger switch, roll a boulder and many mechanisms.
But you only got 13 steps or actions to perform before respawning!

## How to play

You can play with **keyboard**
- <kbd>W</kbd><kbd>A</kbd><kbd>S</kbd><kbd>D</kbd>, or <kbd>Z</kbd><kbd>Q</kbd><kbd>S</kbd><kbd>D</kbd>, or <kbd>Arrows</kbd> to move
-  <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Space</kbd> to validate selections
- <kbd>E</kbd> to undo actions
- <kbd>R</kbd> to restart the level if you are really stuck
-  <kbd>Esc</kbd> to go back to main menu

Or you can play with **gamepad controller**
- <kbd>Stick</kbd> to move
-  <kbd>A</kbd> to validate selections
-  <kbd>L1</kbd>/<kbd>Y</kbd> to undo actions
-  <kbd>R1</kbd> to reset level
-  <kbd>Start</kbd> to go back to main menu


## Level Editor

A level editor to let allow anybody to create and share custom levels!

You can create levels with **mouse** only.
- Pick a tile and place it on level.
- Every level must have **a single flag and current spawn**.
- You can change orientation of some tiles using the selector or **mouse wheel**, which is much more easier
- Some tiles got different colors instead of orientation changes, to allow multiple gong or switch

You can test your own levels, then share the url when it is ended, other players could enjoy your work!
