## Description
In 1266 Marco Polo’s father and uncle, Niccolo and Maffeo Polo, reached the seat of Kublai Khan, the leader of the Mongol Yuan Dynasty, in Dadu (which is now Beijing).

They were asked to bring a letter to the Pope and were given a paiza, a golden tablet that granted them safe passage through the Khan’s lands. They made the journey back west, but were unable to deliver the letter immediately, as the Pope had died and a new one had not yet been elected.

This game is not how their trip went. (For one thing, the paiza was a foot long and 3 inches wide, not the size of Niccolo’s torso). Think of this more like the loosely related NES tie-in game for the historical event.
