# Celestial Paws üêæ

While reading about ‚ÄúBlack Cats‚Äù I learned they‚Äôre not bad luck in Scandinavia.  
In this game, you‚Äôre helping them get stars to put behind the northern lights.

Solve puzzles by placing one cat next to each glowing charm.  
After four puzzles, fly through the clouds to collect stars.
Successful puzzles increase the number of stars you can grab.  

The music and puzzles are generated, so each play through is a little different.  
Some pieces were started on CodePen. They are in this collection [CodePen collection](https://codepen.io/collection/yyJMMr).

## Instructions
- Click empty tiles to place or remove a cat.
- You can reposition cats until the final cat is placed.
- Tags show the number of cats in each line.  
- Cats cannot touch, even diagonally.  
- Every charm must orthogonally touch at least one cat.
- There is no time limit on the puzzles so you can take your time.
- Solve 4 puzzles to start collecting stars for that night.  
- Collect 300 stars to win.  

## Controls
- **Click/tap**: place or remove a cat.  
- **Slider**: steer the cat in the tunnel.
