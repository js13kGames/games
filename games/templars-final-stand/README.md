It’s October 13, 1307. King Philip IV has sent his forces to hunt you down. As one of the last Knights Templar, it’s a battle for survival!

Move across the battlefield, take down enemies, and gather powerful items. But beware - if your total load reaches 13, your **triskaidekaphobia** kicks in, and every step will become a painful struggle.

Each move matters, and survival depends on balancing your strategy. Let’s see how long you can last!

## Controls

- **Click/Tap** to make your selections.
- <kbd>↑</kbd><kbd>↓</kbd><kbd>←</kbd><kbd>→</kbd> / <kbd>W</kbd><kbd>S</kbd><kbd>A</kbd><kbd>D</kbd> to move up, down, left, or right on the keyboard.
- **Swipe** up, down, left, or right on mobile devices to move.

## Rules

- **Move toward** enemies or items to attack or equip.
- **Combine same items** to create stronger versions—except potions, which may either buff or debuff.
- **Equipments (except potions)** add weight, which lasts until the item's duration ends.
- **At a total weight of 13 or more**, every step will cause damage.

## Choose a Class

- **Knight:** Brave and balanced, reliable in combat.
- **Wizard:** Physically weak but able to use potions to attack enemies.
- **Defender:** Reflecting damage back to enemies with his shield.

## Know Your Enemies

- **Whirlstriker:** Strikes surrounding opponents.
- **Guardian:** High shield defense.
- **Counterstriker:** Retaliates against incoming attacks.
- **Spearman:** Penetrates through shields with attacks.
- **Crossblade:** Attacks in a full cross-shaped pattern.
- **Lancepiercer:** Penetrates shields and strikes nearby opponents.
