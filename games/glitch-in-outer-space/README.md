Glitch in outer space

CONTROLS for desktop:
Move: arrow keys or W-A-S-D
Grab/drop: Q
Use: E
Mute: M

CONTROLS for touch devices:
Move: use the joystick on the right
Grab/drop/use/mute: use the buttons on the left

HOW TO:
From the start point there are 7 doors, 6 are locked and will be unlocked as you progress through the puzzles.

There is a tutorial and 5 puzzles in total, plus a bonus. The basic mechanics are shown in the tutorial but some of the puzzles need more than that - be creative, try things and combinations, go explore, use your ears and avoid the flickering glitch monster.
