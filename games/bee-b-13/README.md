Introducing **Bee**, a minimalist game created for the **js13k competition**! The name "Bee" is inspired by the digits "13," which resemble the letter "B," and when spelled out, it perfectly captures the spirit of our winged hero.

In **Bee**, you guide a diligent bee back to its hive, navigating through a world filled with obstacles and tricky flowers. The gameplay takes inspiration from the classic *"Flappy Bird"* style—**tap and hold anywhere above the bee to fly higher**. But beware: **gravity** and the bee’s growing **tiredness** will constantly pull it back down.

As you journey, keep an eye out for **flowers with nectar** to keep your energy up. But not all flowers are safe! **Avoid flowers with 13 petals**—these are either empty or, worse, **poisonous**! Running out of nectar means **no more flying upwards**. However, if you find yourself grounded, don't worry—you can **recharge by resting on the ground**. Just keep in mind that while resting restores your nectar, it also costs you precious time, limiting how far you can travel.

Will you guide your bee back to the hive safely? **Navigate carefully, conserve your energy, and plan your route strategically** in this buzzing adventure!
