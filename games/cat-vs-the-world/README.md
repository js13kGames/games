You’ve always suspected it: cats aren’t here to cuddle, they’re here to conquer.
Now it’s your turn to embrace the chaos!

As the fluffiest agent of destruction, your goal is simple: wreck everything in sight before your human returns. Vases? Smash them. Glasses? Tip them over. That priceless shiny trinket they adore? Send it flying — the shinier the loot, the bigger your score.

But beware of the cactus. Yes, it looks harmless, but one wrong swipe and you’ll learn the spiky truth of regret.

Time is ticking, so claw, pounce, and rampage your way to victory.

Play at home, on the go, or right on top of your human’s laptop (they’ll love that). Works on desktop and mobile!
