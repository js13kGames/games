You are Beverly, an Instagram addict. But today is gonna be the wooorst day of your life: the Internet is down!
It's terrible, because you MUST publish selfies to your followers! You can still use some remaining 3G, but the bandwidth is falling Bytes per Bytes.
Your goal is to fix the Internet! You will have to find a solution by yourself, because everyone is sooo freaking out.
Good luck !

Controls: use arrows to move and space bar to take a selfie in the 3G zones.
