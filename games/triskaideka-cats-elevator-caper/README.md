Triskaideka-Cat is the star of this purr-fectly cuddly elevator caper.  The story begins when our weary traveling hero seeks shelter for the evening at a Totally Normal Hotel:tm:. It turns out this hotel is anything BUT normal, and our hero finds themselves trapped by the nefarious treiska√≠deka-ites.

Now, you must challenge the denizens of each floor and find a way to escape before your nine lives are up.  Jump, collect, flap, and fight the rascally rats that fill the hotel floors--throwing balls of yarn, bopping, and even gambling your way out of treachery.  Reach the 13th floor and a fat cat boss is waiting to annoy you.

Use W, A, S, D or ARROW keys to jump and move, and CLICK or use SPACEBAR to shoot yarn at enemies
