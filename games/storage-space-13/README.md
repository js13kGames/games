Story:
You are a janitor on a freight spaceship, Storage Space 13. After flying through a meteor shower, the ship is a mess. Boxes are all over the place and vents are leaking. You need to clean up the mess of boxes and place them onto the leaking vents on the floor. The gravity system of the ship is a bit broken and is only working on your boots. This means the boxes can only slide forward and only stop when hitting a wall or another box. You need to get close to push them.     

Controls:
- Teleport or push box:  
    - Left mouse button (desktop)
    - Controller Trigger (VR)
- Menu:
    - Escape (desktop)
    - Controller X or A (VR)

Notes:
- If you get a box stuck in a corner, quickly restart the level through the menu.
- You can only teleport to places that are accessible, boxes can block the way.
- You need to be close to a box to push it.
