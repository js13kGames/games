Welcome to "Overforged" where you step into the shoes of a skilled XIII century village blacksmith. Your mission is to keep the villagers and the Lord well-pleased with your craftsmanship. You'll manage your forge, craft weapons and tools, and make crucial decisions to keep your forge running and the people happy. But beware, a displeased Lord can bring an end to your time at the forge. So, craft wisely and manage your resources!
