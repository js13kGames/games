Event Horizon is a 2-player game where battleships of two alien civilizations fight until only one remains! That player take turns, and they may move their ship (arrows, tap screen borders) or shoot (space bar, tap in the middle of the screen). 

What is the "Reversed" component? The battlefield is disturbed by quantum-gravitical waves, so black holes will eventually fill the map. The gravity well can affect the trajectory of ships and projectiles, transforming a simple game in a chaotic nightmare. They can also act as wormholes teleporting projectiles across the map. 

Get ready and defeat your enemy before black holes consumes this portion of the galaxy. And beware, if your laser starts orbiting a black hole, it will energize it creating more gravitical disturbances.
