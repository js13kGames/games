Get Jess Back is a very short choose-your-own-adventure-style game. Text is displayed below the pictures (you'll have to swipe up a bit to see it on mobile).

Use the BACK link (not your phone's back button!) to return to previous points in the story and make new choices. RESTART will keep your score, and let you jump all the way back to the beginning.

Coil subscribers get many more branches than non-monetized users. Finding some endings requires being a subscriber.
