For The Theme 'Death' I decided to make a shoot 'em up based on the Pacific theater of World War II.

The player controls a Grumman F6F Hellcat.

The enemy planes are Mitsubishi A6M "Zero",  Nakajima B5N "Kate" and Mitsubishi G4M "Betty".  Also there are "Fubuki" class destroyers that must me be eliminated in a surface attack wave.
