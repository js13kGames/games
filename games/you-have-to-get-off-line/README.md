"You have to get off line" is a game about walking a fine line, about four pixels thick, between lasers and more lasers.

    Follow the story line to its conclusion through obstacles, of which there are many, to get off line, and into a vast directionless yonder (sold separately).

    Controls: press Spacebar a lot. On a phone, tap on the screen instead.
