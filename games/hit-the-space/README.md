You are on a mission to colonize planets in the nearby system.
Search for habitable planets, but watch out for the dangers of outer space!


How to play:

Hold space to accelerate

Reach checkpoints (pulsing green planets) to advance

Avoid hitting planets and going near black holes

Pay attention to your fuel:
- You can see the remaining fuel in the top left corner (blue bar)
- If you run out of fuel, you cannot accelerate any further
- The fuel will be restored when you reach a checkpoint
- Different amount of fuel is available for each checkpoint

Press Enter or R to self-destruct, and restart at the latest checkpoint
