So you killed the boss but can you make it back from the dungeon?

An very simple Roguelike with reversed perspective (side instead of top down) that starts from the end of the game right after you defeated the last boss deep down in the dungeon.

If you have a keyboard, use the cursor keys to move, space to fight.

On a touch device, use one finger to set the direction you want to move to and two fingers if you want to fight.
