In this game you will be trying to escape a house in under 13 minutes or less. You will need to learn about everyone's powers as you go through the rooms to grab room balls to open the final door.

-- How to Play --
The touch screen is all you need. Preferably play on a tablet or smartphone. Tap on the character icons to change personas on the block you control. Keep in mind that it's important for you to try different personals because certain characters can see things that others can't see. Also, there is 1 very well hidden room in the game... If you can find it, you're so cool!

-- Note to Players --
This is only a submission for the mobile games. Even if you have a touch screen on your desktop computer, there may be a chance that something don't function properly or the touch screen controls get stuck. If it happens, you can press the r button on your keyboard to reset the problem without losing game progress.
