A millennium ago, the great Ark Fleet set out across the galaxy to escape the certain doom of the ancient homeworld.

Many colonies prospered, many failed, and some vanished without trace, disappearing into fokelaw and legend.
      
Whilst an alien curse sweeps across the galaxy, threatening humanity's existence, you form a crew to seek out Ark Ship YTI-404, long thought lost, but which now might carry the answer to defeating the alien threat.

Hold LMB to lock on to enemies.  Release button to fire.  Lock on to multiple enemies to increase multiplier.  Discover ship upgrades and explore the galaxy.

Web monetized users gain an additional bonus upgrade to their ship's systems
