Play as a black cat crossing a busy Halloween street.

## Controls
- On PC, move using WASD or the arrows.
- On mobile,  you can use the left/right buttons (available only on mobile) to go left and right, and to go up just tap anywhere on the screen.

## Gameplay

Your goal is to cross people's roads, causing them bad luck and gaining points for it.

However, you have to be careful, because your cat has a "happiness-meter" with 9 "happy points" on it. Each time you bump into a human, you lose one "happy point" and at zero, your cat gets annoyed and quits.

But, when you cross a road close enough to a human, they have a chance to drop a fish cracker and you can recover lost "happy points" by eating it.

The game generates the level infinitely as you're playing, so try winning as much points as you can! Good **luck** ;)

## ⚠️Technical limitations

Unfortunately, resizing the game doesn't work. If you put your game in full screen, it will cause bad rendering and you have to reload the page to fit the game to the new view port.
