You play as Mochi, a black cat who has been imprisoned in a hostile world

You need to escape a series of areas under the cover of darkness to regain your freedom

Electricity is not your friend, control it using red levers

Water and sharp spikes are also to be avoided where possible

You only have 9 halves of heart for lives, when these are gone you need to restart the level

Your only defence against guardian drones and sweepers is to lure them to electric fields or water

Springs can help you access hard-to-reach places

Collect keys to unlock doors - press Down whilst on a locked door, then press Down on an unlocked door to use it

Once you have collected all the coins, look for the chequered finish point on each level to progress to the next

Controls are :

Keyboard - Movement ... Cursors / WASD (or equivalently positioned keys, ZQSD etc) / ZX;. 

Gamepad - Move...Left stick, Jump...Left stick Up or South button
