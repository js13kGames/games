Will you make it through the torment of hell in this bullet hell?

A small story mode with 7 long level, an arcade mode with 48 small level, and a complete level editor !

The bullet hell genra in its purest form ; no shooting, no grazing, only survival and concentration.

Controls : 
arrow : move
ctrl : slow your character

And that's all :)

Sadly there is no music and the story mode is not exactly what I imagined, but I don't really have the time to finish
