Why unfinished? My mistake was my workflow and lack of design.
 
1. first I made good amount of coding but I was doing this in very bottom-up way, without thinking of concrete gameplay/game goal.
2. then I put project on hold (had other things to do)
3. day before deadline I wanted to finish this, and designed clear gameplay for a player using sticky notes 
4. then I started implementing lacking pieces
5. but was too late to create all game features (not to mention playability tests)

I overally spent 34 hours. But I learned a lot. So it was worth it.
