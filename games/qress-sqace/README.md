This game works only in Google Chrome because I use Audio time to control animation (nobody should ever do that), sorry.

The game doesn't scale on height. Canvas size is 1000px. If you play this on laptop, use at least Chrome in full screen. You should be able to see a white bar in the bottom.

This is a very simple game inspired by three other games I like: Tyrian, ZType and Taiko no Tatsujin.

As you press a key, music start playing and you need to hit the notes. To hit a note, you press a corresponding key of the note and have your "spaceship" in the right slot.
