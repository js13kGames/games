Canvas size is 1000px. If you play this on laptop, use at least Chrome in full screen. You should be able to see a white bar in the bottom.<p>This is a very simple game inspired by three other games I like: Tyrian, ZType and Taiko no Tatsujin.<p>As you press a key, music start playing and you need to hit the notes. To hit a note, you press a corresponding key of the note and have your "spaceship" in the right slot.<p>Letters are generated on page load so as the music repeats, you can memorize the letters better.<p>The green bars are useless, ignore them. So is the name. The first idea was a bit different. I didn't have much time for this project and the result code is a mess. But I learned something so that is going good for me. No library was used to make this game and that was definitely a mistake :D I will take a look for some good libraries for next year.<p>So the goal is to hit all the notes! :) Good luck.<p>Checkout out github for more info: <a href=https://github.com/nesro/js13k-2021-press-space>https://github.com/nesro/js13k-2021-press-space</a></div><script src=game.min.js></script>
