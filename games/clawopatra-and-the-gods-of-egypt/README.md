Cats rule the world – especially black ones ;) So, become the Black Cat – God of Egypt!

Lead your civilization to world domination. Manage its development, control your followers, and battle hostile empires. Your goal is to conquer all territories, but beware – you cannot allow the capital to fall into enemy hands!

Collect and use your divine powers, which recharge faster the more tiles of a given type you control. Each use increases their cost and range. Choose wisely to shape the terrain, convert enemies, or wreak havoc:

FLOOD: Lowers terrain by one level in the selected area
CONVERSION: Converts enemy territories to player territories
BLESSING: Claims empty territories for the player
PLAGUE: Removes all enemy units in the area
EXALTATION: Raises terrain by one level in the selected area

Click on a fully charged divine power and select a target field on a map. 
May the cat gods be with you!

TIPS AND TRICKS: 

1) You can separate yourself from the enemy with a mountain range or sea.
2) If you use a blessing to create a new settlement in a part not yet occupied by the enemy, you will be prepared for their arrival.
3) Take over an entire new enemy tribe before it expands too much by using conversion – it will work to your advantage.
4) By terraforming land already occupied by you, you can balance the type of terrain you possess and thus accelerate the charging of the divine powers you desire.
5) If you change the terrain to inaccessible terrain (deep water or mountain peaks), you will kill all enemies in that area.
6) If you want to increase the impact, use several powers in quick succession in close proximity to overwhelm the enemy

I hope you have a great time playing this game! Don't show it to cats, they might take over the world ;)

I really wanted to make a strategy game this year – the idea definitely cost me a few gray hairs, but I succeeded ;)

Unfortunately, the amount of code didn't allow me to prepare the music and sounds – I had to give up on that.

Best regards,
