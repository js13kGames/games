# FLYKT

A physics platformer that's all about solving levels using momentum, portals, and precise movement. Aim, charge, and fire a black cat through interesting puzzles across city rooftops and alleyways. Can you solve them all?

# How to play

Aim: hold <kbd>Space</kbd> on ground, Aim with <kbd>A</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd>  release <kbd>Space</kbd> to launch.

Portals: <kbd>Mouse Left</kbd> = Blue, <kbd>Mouse Right</kbd> = Orange

Reset current level: <kbd>R</kbd>

# Tips

* Hold jump in the air to stick the landing!

* Sometimes an easier, less precise route can be found!
