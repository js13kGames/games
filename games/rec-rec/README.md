Make a rap with loops!
This is a remake of the Rec-Rec minigame in the Electroplankton audio game for Nintendo DS from 2005.  I wanted to see if I could recreate it using web audio and canvas, in under 13k :)  Everything is generated in code, there are no other assets.

Microphone required for recording.
Due to lack of support for the MediaRecorder API, recording will not work on iOS/Safari/Edge. It works on Android/Chrome/Firefox.
