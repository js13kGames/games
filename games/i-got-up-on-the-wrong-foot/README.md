  summary: How I built a top-20 js13kGames placement with a black-cat themed point-and-click adventure full of SVG graphics, a day-night cycle and dozens of superstitions — and broke the record for most js13k submissions over the years.

It's your (unlucky) day! You got up on the wrong foot.

Make 26 superstitions come true before midnight to be as unlucky as possible.

The game features weather events and events that happen at specific times of the day... keep your eyes and your ears open!

Thanks to Séverine, Adrien and Maurice for their invaluable help.
