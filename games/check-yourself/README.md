Check Yourself is a spin on traditional 8x8 checkers. You play as a single piece, with a haphazard AI controlling the enemies and your allies.

It incorporates this year's "Lost" theme in a mechanical sense. Playing as 1 of 12 checkers on a team, you've lost control of the big picture you normally have while playing. Also, you can only see the whole board in short bursts; on your turn, you see what your checker sees ... so you've lost perspective.
