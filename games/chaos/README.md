YOUR PLANET IS IN DANGER. THE ENEMY IS TRYING TO WIPE OUT EVERY LAST BEING OF YOUR SPECIES. YOU MANAGE TO TRACK DOWN THE LEADER OF THE INVADERS. DEFEAT THE ENEMY TO SECURE THE FATE OF YOUR PLANET.

CHAOS RAINS DOWN EACH TIME YOU MANAGE TO DEFEAT THE ENEMY AS YOU ARE STUCK IN A TIME LOOP.
USE W/D OR LEFT/RIGHT ARROW KEYS TO MOVE AND SPACEBAR TO SHOOT.
USE THE MOUSE TO FIRE ENERGY SHOTS AT THE ENEMY.

GOOD LUCK!
