Lord Balsekil (do not look that name up in your VolapÃ¼k dictionary, it might frighten you!) stole your seven purple lucky charms and hid them in his Lairs of Bad Luck. So fight him, his thirteen henchmen and your superstition to get them back!

The game is a Rogue-like, especially it is round-based, so take all the time you need for your next step. There are two modes: a short game and a normal game. The normal game has thirteen levels, the short game is, well, shorter, for those who just want to quickly see as much as possible to judge the game. The levels are randomly generated, so no two games will be the same.

If winning is either too hard or too easy for you, you can try to improve your score.

## Moving

* Use the number pad to move (arrow keys also work, but lack diagonal directions). Press shift to walk until you hit a wall or see an enemy.
* Press > or < when you are on a ladder to climb down or up.
* Press x to automatically explore the level (enemies will interrupt you).
* You will automatically collect all items you walk over.
* Or click on the place you want to go to (if you have seen it before), this also works for using ladders.
* If you prefer the traditional hjkl-yubn-keys, these are also supported.

## Attacking

* You can perform both melee and ranged attacks.
* For a melee attack just try to walk into the enemy.
* For a ranged attack press f (followed by a number if more than one enemy is visible). Or click on your target.
* Press w to wait a turn and W to wait until an enemy appears.
* Press e to eat a mushroom (if you have one, might be good before tough fights). Or click on it in your inventory.
* Note that your initial attack is quite weak, so try to find a horseshoe as soon as possible. Running away from enemies can be a good idea in many cases.

## Other

* Toggle the sounds by pressing m or using the button on the top.
* Start a new game by pressing Q (or just reloading).

Mobile users please note: The game works without keyboard, but your screen should not be too small.
