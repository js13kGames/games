You must reach best highscore in most games, but there is no highscore in this one. There is lowscore instead of it. And your main goal is to reach lowscore 0.

Click mouse to move your character, click enemy to attack it. Click spell to cast it (you can also use numerical keys 1 - 8). To complete the level you must enter the door.

Good luck!
