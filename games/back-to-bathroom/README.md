Description:

You are in bathroom and see that all you do over there go back for you. But you are hungry, if not eat then you die. Yet you can eat bread that falls, but the more you eat the more shit comes back to you.

Controls:

ENTER - Start/Pause/Continue
A/D or Right/Left - Move Player
SPACE - Pull toilet
E - Discharge

Tips:

The more you eat, the more you crap.
The more you crap, the more discharges you can give and the more xShit you'll get.
The more xShit the more Shit Score you get.
The more shit on the ground, the faster your life falls.
If you have xShit at zero, your life will fall very quickly.
Be quick to hit E to flush (it's stuck XD)
