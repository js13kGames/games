This game is a memory-game mixed with puzzle exploration game, where black holes transport your ship to new universes on a trek to find a place to call home.

- Use WASD to move your probes and ships
- Find your way through universes and avoid black holes that lead to a Universe Not Found
- A failed journey leaves behind a red marker to aid future adventurers
- Your probes (green) are deployed first
- Your ships (blue) are then deployed if no more probes exist
- You have a limited fuel supply on each ship, running out will mean certain doom for that vessel
