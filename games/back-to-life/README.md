Story line:

Cold,
A shard of ice hit your back,
feel the shivers going down your spine.

Hot,
A burst of flames
Coming from the same place

You're losing your strength,
You're losing your will.

Confused,
you fall on your knees.

You cough
and paint
the green grass
turns into red.

The world
starts spinning around.
The world
starts fading away.
It moves faster and faster.
All the sounds
turns into noise.

Everything turns grey,
everything blurs away.

The world keeps spinning
even more,
then suddenly stops
when you hit the ground.

Yet,
your spirit
is still so strong.
Refuses to surrender,
Refuses to die.

As you float above
your dead body,
you regain your strength
and only one thought
stayed in your mind:
"I must come back".
