  summary: I was able to preserve my 8-year streak of participating in this game jam. I'd like to share some of the "low-tech tech" I've used — many of these are low-level development techniques that help me create tiny games.

The spirit cat, protector of the valley and guardian of Meow Mountain, took a slightly too long nap. In that time, the 
valley fell into disarray - the protective barrier keeping evil spirits at bay has collapsed, and the weary villagers 
have stopped worshiping their feline protector. Can you restore peace to Whisker's Valley?

## Game tips _(spoilers ahead)_

- The game is not about killing spirits; running away is often the best strategy
- Use the cornered cat bonus strategically by letting 3+ spirits surround you
- Sleep in the first house to heal and you can teleport from each alter to your home altar
- Repairing statues naturally increases difficulty, but high superstition accelerates it even faster
