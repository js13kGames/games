The spirit cat, protector of the valley and guardian of Meow Mountain, took a slightly too long nap. In that time, the valley fell into disarray - the protective barrier keeping evil spirits at bay has collapsed, and the weary villagers have stopped worshiping their feline protector. Can you restore peace to Whisker's Valley?

- The game is not about killing spirits; running away is often the best strategy

- Repairing statues naturally increases difficulty, but high superstition accelerates it even faster
