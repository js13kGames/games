I ended up putting in six wonderful work sessions of joy on this experiment! I'm really proud of how it is coming along. I only had thursday afternoons to work on my game this year, and each of these afternoons was so much fun! I thoroughly enjoyed the process of not being encumbered by janky bloated middleware or a feature-rich game engine! I spend so much of my life navigating giant complext game engine bloat... vanillaJS is so refreshing and free, easy and simple. 

Honestly I liked doing from-scratch so much I am seriously considering abandoning using game engines altogether! I love doing it from scratch so much because I can remember every part (since I'm the one who created it) - I never need to google anything!
