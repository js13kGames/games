High in the Karpathian mountains two little kids Attu and Juno were playing snowballs. One thrown snowball missed itâ€™s target, flew away and started rolling down the mountain.

Keep the snowball rolling to get as far as you can! Click anywhere to set the trampoline to jump over the kids, bears, foxes and the rocks! Be patient at night!
