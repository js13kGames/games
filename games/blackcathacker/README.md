How to play

Platform your way  in front of the computer, then  spam all the letter keys on you keyboard with your paws to commit as much malicious code as you can before your owner comes back!

When your owner is at the computer not only can Script not use it, but her owner will also start undoing her hard work, Luckily hes a filthy casual vibe coder and hes quite slow.  Script can speed things up  by knocking his leftover coffee cups off shelves and onto the ground to distract them and get back on keys, by knocking the cups around with SPACE

Rules of the Game:

BlackCat_Hacker is split into seven rounds, each representing one work day. Your goal is to try to ship as much code each day and fill your git graph (it makes potential employers compliment your resume before they reject you).

At the end of seven days you will be ranked on your hacking ability based on how many lines of malicious code you shipped!

Your goal is to aim to ship 1000 lines of code a day or more and claim the coveted Master black cat hacker fedora!
