Five years ago, a little black cat with a small white dot on her chest came to my back door. We named her Kiki and began feeding her out back. After a year or so, we brought her inside and gave her all the love we could. She passed away almost exactly a year ago.

This game is in honor of her. Give food and water to outdoor cats. Try to bring them in and take care of them. Work to earn money to buy supplies at the store, but be careful of how much time you spend away from your cats. After all, they who have the most cats wins at life.

You mostly just click things. Click a cat to zoom in, so you can try to catch it or name it.
