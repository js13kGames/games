This is my first try at the WebXR category. I did this myself and didn't have much time to finish it by 13th September, unfortunately, because I started 9th grade. I'll continue to develop purplFLOW on the game's GitHub page until it's an eventually feature-complete game.I would love any ideas/help on the game in any way! You can open an issue (or read what I'm planning to add)

Controls: WASD+Mouse (desktop)/Tap+Look (VR+mobile)
When you see the gun move, it's reloading. It has 7 bullets, but you can edit the javascript to make it 9001 bullets.Enjoy!

You can read more about me or purplFLOW on my Medium post soon (link above)

"I always get downvotes for this but this quote was from a long time ago when you shipped on cartridges, now itâ€™s not true. You could make a bad game and a year later it could be amazing. No matter of reactions of the failed launch, it can be amazing from updates."-u/StavTL
