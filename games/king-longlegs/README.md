A small, challenging platformer set in an bleak, empty world. Journey through tunnels and caverns to find and defeat the evil thirteen-legged king, who lurks somewhere far below. Along the way, find secret paths, solve puzzles, and learn to face your fears.

Use WAD or the left/right/up arrow keys to move around.

## Troubleshooting

This game is mostly framerate-independent... but if you're having issues making jumps, try changing your display refresh rate to 60 Hz. Also, while it's been verified to run on the latest Firefox and Chrome, it might cause issues with some drivers.

## Interesting technical details

The legs are drawn using inverse kinematics techniques (specifically, the easy two-segment case) and automatically adapt to the terrain.

## Secret areas

Two. They're not particularly hidden, but they're easy to miss if you're moving quickly.
