DarkLine Paws is a collection of three lightweight, browser-based games that put you in the paws of a curious cat. Built using pure vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas, these games are designed to be played directly in your browser without any external dependencies, offering a nostalgic, pixelated art style.

The collection features three distinct gameplay experiences:

Move: W/S or ↑/↓

Strafe: A/D

Turn: ←/→ or Q/E

Run: Shift

Cat Jumper (Rooftop Adventure): A fast-paced, 2D endless runner where you jump between rooftops.

Jump: Spacebar or Click

Menu: ESC

Tic-Tac-Toe (Vs Cat AI): A classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe where you, playing as "X" (a paw print), challenge a cunning computer-controlled cat opponent.

Select: Click a cell on the board

Restart: Click the "Restart" button

Key Features
We're particularly proud of the technical implementation that makes these games so accessible and unique. The use of vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas for rendering ensures that the games are incredibly lightweight and can run smoothly in any modern browser. Additionally, the challenging Cat AI in Tic-Tac-Toe offers a surprisingly robust opponent, providing a fun and competitive experience for players. The entire project is modular, with each game contained in its own file, making the design clean and efficient.
