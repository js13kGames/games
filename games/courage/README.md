A game for JS13k 2024 by Nicklas LÃ¶f. Follow me on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@snukey)

## Story
Help Billy to overcome his 13 different phobias by playing 9 different chapters in a simple 2D dungeon crawler with arcade style battles.

## Controls
Play with mouse and keyboard. Using a trackpad is probably going to be very **difficult**

**WASD** or **Arrow keys** to move around

**Mouse** to aim

**Left mouse button** to fire

**Right mouse button** or **Space** to glide on the floor to avoid taking damage

**E** to throw bombs

## Lights
Please notice that the game is quite **dark** in some areas so it's **recommended** to not play in broad daylight or in a very lit room.

## Difficulty
There are three different difficulty levels. Easy, Normal and Hard. The difference is a balance between more enemies with more health, bombs with lesser range and faster boss mechanics. In hard difficulty you will get more bombs because you really need them.

## Mini map
Below the courage meter there is a mini map of the current level. Green is the exit. Blue is the room you are in currently. Plan your journey trough the level by going in the opposite direction of the exit so you don't have to run back and forth if you are reaching the exit too early.

## Save function and random generated rooms
If you quit the game and return later it will remember the chapter you last played and continue from there but all levels are random generated so the level layout and also some room layouts will be different from every play.
