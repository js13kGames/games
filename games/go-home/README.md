Hi there!
Cats are lost. The owner waits.
A black cat knows the way.
Lead them. Guide them.
Together, they must return!!
Use the arrow keys to control the cats and make sure all of them return home together safely.
Be careful — if you take 13 steps without success, you’ll lose the stage.
But don’t worry, perhaps a small hint will appear after each failure to help you along the way! XDD
Notice: Each item’s function matches the color of a cat.
