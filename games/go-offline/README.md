The title says it all: go offline to get some score.

And you can beat you hi score.

And there are 13 silly achievements to unlock.

Have fun :)

Browser support:

Desktop: game tested and works in latest Chrome and Firefox; Safari seems to pretend it's always online which makes the game impossible to play; not tested in IE nor Edge (which in theory supports all APIs in use).

Mobile: game tested on Android in latest Chrome and Firefox, also works in latest iOS Safari. Please note that on mobile getting some of the achievements will require (not to spoil too much) "additional tools".
