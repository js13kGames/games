Disconnect the machines before being caught!

This is simple (relatively incomplete!) simultaneous turn-based random maze game. 

Press Enter to start and use the Arrow keys to move.

There are two kinds of baddies -

Guards (Red) who move quickly and are out to catch you. Engineers (Green) who are slow and just want to fix up the cables you break.

The object of the game is to remove cables so that the machines (green blocks!) are disconnected from each other.
