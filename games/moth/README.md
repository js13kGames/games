Ambushed, beheaded, burned, and trapped in a wrought iron coffin. Once an almost invincible necromancer, your last remaining toehold in this world is the only nearby creature -- a moth.

Escape your tomb, now full of vengeful ghosts, by possessing an army of restless moths. Gather resources, build defenses, and then strike out for the tomb's exit. Are you ready to reclaim your former glory?
