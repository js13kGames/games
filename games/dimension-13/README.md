Your teleporter's power is depleted, and you're stranded in the 13th dimension, courtesy of the 𝐏𝐎𝐋𝐀𝐍𝐃 𝐒𝐏𝐀𝐂𝐄 𝐏𝐑𝐎𝐆𝐑𝐀𝐌. To escape, you must retrieve all 7 power gems. But beware—your greatest 𝐅𝐄𝐀𝐑 is dying of hypothermia if your temperature drops below -𝟏𝟑°C. Retreat to the teleporter or find a campfire to 𝐖𝐀𝐑𝐌 𝐔𝐏 before it's too late.

Controls:

WASD: Move around the map
Click: Attack
Shift: Run
Controller Support: Left stick to move, right stick to look, and shoulder buttons to sprint or attack
Note:

𝗪𝗔𝗥𝗡𝗜𝗡𝗚: This game is GPU-intensive, and animations may lag on low-end devices. Press Ctrl + Plus or Ctrl + Minus to rescale and reload if needed. Also, an adult-sized diaper is recommended—there's a high chance you'll wet yourself while playing.

Age Rating: 13+ (so I can play it)

Good Luck: Which, honestly, you won’t need, because you’re gonna die anyway. 😈

How It Fits the Theme:

Surviving in the 13th dimension isn’t just about collecting gems—it’s about keeping your suit's temperature above -13°C. The 13th dimension is full of unlucky surprises (you’ll see).

BTW, check out my YouTube channel and my other projects on Itch.io. I’m Andrei, a 13-year-old developer, even IDK when I started gamedev exactly. This is my third time at JS13k, and I’m here to learn and make cool games!

I'm gonna submit it on Arcadia, that's why I put it on the Decentralized category. Hopefully they accept it :)

Feedback and constructive criticism are welcome—be honest and have fun. ✌️
