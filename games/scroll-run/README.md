It's a quick and simple game about running as fast as you can, and then running back again ;)
I woke up with an idea for this on a Sunday morning just before the end of the competition and decided to implement it quickly.
I found it quite fun (and have learned some things!), hope you will as well.

CONTROLS: 
Just scroll as fast as you can. Best with touch screen or touchpad, and should work with mouse wheel as well.

For an additional fun challenge on mobile, pretend your index and middle fingers are legs and run on top of your touch screen ;)
