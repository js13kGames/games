It has been a long time since you last saw your friends. You board your rocket and fly back into Ceres... will you be able to gather the gang back together? 

Race across the galaxy, become an asteroid miner, and fish legendary creatures from deep space as you hop from planet to planet, following the lives of your now distant friends.
