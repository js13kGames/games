Ace Cadet! is my little take on the old top-down, retro graphics space genre. You play as an Ace Cadet defending their homeworld. Intruders are attacking, and it is your job to stop them! Keep their numbers low as their attack intensifies.

This project is built with Kontra.js and uses Protocol Lab's DRAND (https://drand.love) to seed a number of game changes, such as player attributes, enemy attributes, and weapon attributes.
