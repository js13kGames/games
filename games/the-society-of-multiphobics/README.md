In this puzzle game you have the role of an Event Planner for the dinner of the Society of Multiphobics. 

Your task is to assign all the guests to chairs at the tables in such a way that no phobia is triggered.

## Info & Controls
All levels are solvable.

All the required information is displayed within the game, but here are some backup infos just in case:
- the guests are represented by emojis
- the phobias of each guest are represented below the emoji (again emojis) 
- everyone suffers from triskaidekaphobia
- select an emoji to get more information about the phobias
- change the position by using drag and drop or clicking an empty chair
- you can also use the empty fields as intermediate move
- the game is won when all guests are seated correctly

- note: some guests are represented by object emojis, treat them as persons nevertheless :)

### About the score calculation
The score is based on the amount of moves. 

You get the highest score (9999⭐️) if you solve the level in the least amount of moves possible (par).

When you need as much moves as the level has guests, you still get 2000⭐️. Then it slowly decreases to 0⭐️

Note: Calculating the optimal par was one of the hardest parts. The final solution is not perfect, but works for most cases.

## Stats & Fun Facts
- this is my 4th time participating
- I worked ~90 hours on this game (longest time so far), but I had a lot of fun 😁
- My husband supported me an extra ~10 hours (DevOps + the drag&drop feature)
- 10% of the coding happened on a plane over the Atlantic ✈️ and another ~40% while travelling the US 🇺🇸 
- I spent around 4 hours on the music using SoundBox. I used the only song I know how to play on the piano 🎹 and added some drums and bass
- I did around 15 iterations with Poki playtests, which gave me some good insights, especially to improve the tutorial

## Next steps if I had more time and space
- improve scoring system
- additional modes, e.g. time-based or gambling
- add custom svgs
- add sounds
