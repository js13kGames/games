A survival game where you're trying to keep alive while fighting a dark cult. 

On every 13th kill, a demon will appear and the difficulty slightly increases. After killing the demon, a random item either to power up your sword or to heal yourself is spawned.

Control the player using arrow keys and the attack will follow the movement direction.
