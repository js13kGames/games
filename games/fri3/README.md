A game for [JS13k](//js13kgames.com/) 2024 by [Ilya Kuzmichev](//x.com/eliaskuvoice) and [Alexandra Alhovik](//x.com/alxovikaa)

The goal of the game is to have fun through a series of bloody murders of happy students. Play and remember why you're afraid of **Friday the 13th**.  

A **katana**, an **axe** and **shelters** will help you in the murder, but beware of **the police**. You can level up by killing students and collecting xp points.

Have a juicy game and watch out for the police!
