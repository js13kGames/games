After centuries of reverence and grave robbing,
By bandits, emperors and pharao's alike,
The Tomb of Alexander the Great was destroyed,
Presumed lost for ever.

Unbeknownst to all, the body of the King was re-taken,
To be interred in his home country.
Now, there in the ancient mountains of Macedonia,
Alexander rests for ever, in the Valley of the King.

But even now his tomb is not safe, not safe from you!
After years of travel and research,
You have located the Valley of the King,
Where now you must solve the final riddle;

        The King's Crowns

        13 crowns King Alexander possessed
        13 crowns by the Devil oppressed
        13 crowns for Day and Night
        13 crowns that show the Kingâ€™s might
        13 crowns with a cursed spell
        13 crowns that lead to Hell!
