  ### Fear Meter
  - The more fear, the faster you shoot, the more powerups you find
  - Meter grows when enemies escape, when you progress sectors, when you die
  - Meter shrinks when enemies die and you get powerups

  ### Death
  - All powerups lost
  - Score multiplier reset
  - Invulnerability for ~2 seconds

  ### Score
  - Different enemies worth different point values
  - Collecting powerups you already have adds .5x to score multiplier

  ### Powerups
  - Rate of Fire Increase - faster firing main gun
  - Extra Guns - 2 on the wing tips
  - Diagonal Guns - 2 from the ships nose
  - Bomb - seeks enemies, detonates if target destroyed before impact
  - Extra Bomb - 2 more enemy seekers
  - Shield - Absorbs 4 projectiles/collisions, will not spawn if player has shield
  - Extra Life - Max 3

  ### Enemies
  - Blue #1 - 20pts - shoots lasers
  - Blue #2 -40pts - shoots bullets at player
  - Green - 60pts - chonky shield guy
  - Pink - 80pts - fast moving diver
  - Yellow #1 - 100pts - hides in corners, shoots diagonally
  - Yellow #2 - 10pts - not very exciting

  ### Strategy
  - Don't die
  - If you die, use invulnerability to pick up any powerups on screen
  - If shield is low, take the final hit in a lull to find a new shield
