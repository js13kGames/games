An asteroid space mining sim based on the old game K240 for the Amiga (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K240).  This was such a great game, and my contribution might be classed as a demake. ;-)

You start as a space engineer working for MineCorp (imaginative!) charged with setting up mining colonies in a faraway system.

Walk around the asteroid using "A" and "D" (or arrow keys), and "W" to jump.  Otherwise, use the mouse to select buildings and place them (buildings can also be placed with SPACE).

There was so much to add in terms of zipping around, so make sure to hop on the cargo ship to the asteroid of your choosing.
