# A VOIDING YOUR PROBLEMS: A Friendship Quest

Poor little stray Vicki is a void kitten who has just been adopted into a busy apartment building, ruled over by the resident tabby, Queen Kara III. She will have to prove herself by helping the other cats living in the building to build trust with Kara and be accepted as one of the clowder. Will you help her making this place her new home? (Based on a true story.)

## Features

A Voiding Your Problems is a collection of 6 simple catty minigames where you need to prove your worth to the other cats.

Included are the following games:
- Paw Paw Toe with Orange Cat, The Useless Boyfriend
- Meowmory with Molly
- Meowjong with Pablo
- Sudocat with Kumba
- Meowsterpiece with Cha Cha
- Meowsweeper with Queen Kara III

The game is optimised for both mobile and desktop gameplay, you can use your touchscreen or your mouse and keyboard shortcuts (arrows, A-D, 1-0 digits, X, space) to control the minigames.

It has been tested on recent versions of desktop Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Edge and mobile Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Samsung Internet. It requires WebGL2, support for which is fortunately ubiquitous by now.
