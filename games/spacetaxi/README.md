This is the Starships latest usecase: Interplanetary Taxi Service!
 -> use the [left] and [right]-arrowkeys to turn the starship
 -> use the [up]-arrowkey to fire the boosters
Customers (red circles) are waiting on planets, the green markers around your starship will guide you there.
Try to transport as many customers as you can, without crashing into anything...
There is no Game-Over, you will respawn after every rapid unscheduled disassembly.
But if you had a customer aboard, this customer may be unhappy ;-)
