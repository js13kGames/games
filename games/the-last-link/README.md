Eliminate your opponent's links, the last one with the fewest broken links (404) will win the game.

You will have two modes to play:

Offline:

Play on your same device against another person or start a game against a bot.

Online:

Start a game with anyone who is connected, or if you prefer, create a private room to play with a friend, you can also interact through emojis to express how you feel during a game.

Create a board in party mode and use your mobile device as a remote control, in this mode, there is no time, or interaction through emojis since it is a mix between the offline mode in which there is only one board and the online mode since an internet connection is required, it is intended that the players are physically in the same place.
