A space shooter running in reverse.

Control the spaceship with WASD or arrow keys.
Shoot with space bar or enter key.

Destroy the enemy ships and collect power ups (shield, fire power, extra life)

Written for the desktop but has rough touch support for mobile devices.

Tested with firefox and chrome on desktop, and safari and chrome on mobile.

Have fun
