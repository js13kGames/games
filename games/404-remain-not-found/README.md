A turn-based stealth puzzle game.
You must maneuver your two sneaky characters to the end of each room without being seen.

Tap or click within the highlighted area to move there. 
The further you move each turn, the louder your footsteps will be.

Distract guards by clicking the clap button (bottom right).

You can zoom in and out by using the scroll wheel or pinch gesture.
