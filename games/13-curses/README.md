13 Curses is a card game where the first player to have exactly 13 *curses* loses.

### Playing
A game of 13 Curses starts with each player drawing three cards into their hand.

Three cards are added to the shop at the start of each round. Any cards left in the the shop from the previous round are removed first.

Players take it in turns to act. The player with the most *curses* goes first each turn. A coin flip decides the order if each player has the same number of *curses*.

A dice is rolled by the player at the start of their turn. The result of the roll is added to the player's points. The points gained are multiplied depending on how many *curses* the player has:

* 7 - 9 Curses: 2x points.
* 10 - 12 Curses: 3x points.
* 14 - 16 Curses: 4x points.

The player can use these points to buy cards from the shop. Purchased cards are added to the player's hand.  
The player can play any cards from their hand. Cards that would result in a negative number of *curses*, or *curses* over 16 for either player, may not be played.

The player can choose to end their turn without buying of playing any cards. The next player then has their turn. Once each player has had a turn, the round ends and another round starts.

Once any player reaches exactly 13 *curses*, the game is over.
