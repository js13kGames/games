# Catch the Black Cat 13 times

> Legends say a mysterious black cat roams these lands. Some believe it **brings fortune**,
> others whisper itâ€™s a **shadow of bad luck**.

Your goal: **find it, follow it, and catch it** â€” but beware...
the cat is **clever, fast, and always one step ahead.**

## From the Developer
This game was built during a full month of focused work â€” I took vacation time to dive in.
The main goals were to:
- **Vanilla JS for WebXR** â€“ no frameworks, no libs. Not even allowed ones, just raw JS and browser APIs.
- **Cross-platform** â€“ VR, mobile, and desktop.
