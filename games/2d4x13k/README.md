This is a 4x genre inspired game.
You will need to mine resources, research stars and planets, and outfit your ship to get the job done!

# Controls: 
Everything is controlled via touch / mouse.

# Monetization:
Coil subscribers get access to a stronger starting vessel, the Abandoned Imperial Cruiser. This ship starts with all systems at level 1.

# Tips:
- Your starting vessel will determine what systems you start with. All systems can be installed and upgraded regardless.
  - The Abandoned Imperial Cruiser provides the easiest start.
  - The Rusted Mining Vessel would be a close second.
  - The Old Research Vessel is not much tougher than the mining ship.
  - The Retired Combat Vessel is the hardest start by far, and is not recommended for new players.
- Start with nearby stars, travel time with a level 1 engine can be long.
- Make use of Jump Gates to save time traversing the galaxy.
- !!Keep completing contracts to progress the game!!
