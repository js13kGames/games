*In the dimming embrace of twilight, you wander through the shadowed woods, a young apothecary driven by a quiet desperation. The light fades faster than your hopes, casting long, mournful shadows over the earth. The leaves whisper secrets of the night as you search, your hands trembling as they sift through the undergrowth, seeking the elusive plants and fungi that may hold the cure. Time is slipping away, as relentless as the fever burning within your small, distant home. You know the night is closing in, and with it, the chance to save a life.*
