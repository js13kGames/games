Shoot enemies to score points. Chain kills to increase your multiplier and power up your cannon. If an enemy gets past you, the score multiplier is reset! Hitting an enemy with your ship will trigger an explosion and kill all enemies. But if you get hit three times it's Game Over!

Move left and right using [a] and [d] or arrow left and right.
Aim cannons with mouse cursor.
Fire with [space] or left mouse button.
Pause and resume with [p].

Should work in all latest browsers but probably best in chrome.
