Fly over a landscape to catch a red pigeon without sensors, pannel, or radio. You must to pilot a plane inclining your head as you need.

This game tries to be a nice place to wonder, while you try to catch the proposed objective.

This game also works on a desktop with arrow keys, although it is not on that category.
