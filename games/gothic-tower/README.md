There has been a disruption in the space-time continuum and you have to fix it. Go back to the 13th century Gothic Tower and collect all the green time stones. 

Note: Before you exit you need to collect ALL the green coins. In the time warp process some unfriendly creatures might have escape into our dimension. Eliminate them with your ray gun (<kbd>x</kbd>). You have also been equipped with a jet pack (<kbd>z</kbd>). Good luck!
