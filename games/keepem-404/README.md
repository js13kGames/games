Keep'em 404
-----------

The web browser is under attack! Evil websites are approaching! As long as you can keep the page showing a 404 the client is fine. 

Try to place the 5 different types of towers around the world and prevent the pages to reach the browser.

The more expensive a tower the more powerful it is. You can upgrade towers to become stronger and fight longer. 

All towers are extra efficient against a specific enemy:

- Shields against Ads
- Certificates against Unsafe connections
- First Aid against Viruses
- Magnifier against Phishing 
- Firewall against Spyware

The game is playable in the desktop browser and on VR headsets.
