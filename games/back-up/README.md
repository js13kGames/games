Stranger asks You for help in quite bizarre case. Apparently she wants You to make her backup, but who even is she? Find out Yourself in this simple puzzle game, based on good old laser reflections game type.

Controls:
Only mouse is needed -> tutorial is in game

We couldn't test it on VR unfortunetly (We don't own headset for it), but it should work.
