Shoot at the balls with the correct answer. 2 x 13 spacy questions.
Correct answers will be rewarded (health, friends, points), wrong answers will be punished.

Controls:
Aim with the mouse and shoot with left click or tap.
Keep the left mouse button pressed for longer fire.
Optional: Press Space bar key for a tactical jump to any point in space (your cursor position). You have a max. of 13 jumps.

Mobile:
It should be playable on mobile too. But no time left to test multiple devices.
(you can survive without tactical jumps by space bar key)

Ships:
Red: enemies - shoot at you
Green: friends - shoot at enemies
Yellow: neutral - may turn to enemies or friends if hit

Tip:
Friendly fire mode is on. So don't shoot too hard at the answers!
Too many ships at once create a mess, cause they might shoot at random answers.
(Enemies get more and more powerful with each level.)
 
Good luck and have fun :)
