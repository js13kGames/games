The basic idea is to create a network of servers, switches, routers, and PSUs.

The beefy-er your servers, the more traffic you can support; the more responsive your servers, the faster traffic will come.

You have to connect all your machines to the correct ports, such that all your servers have network access and power.

But be careful, power costs money so the more servers you have running, the more money you will be spending.
