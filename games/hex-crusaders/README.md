A small band of Templars has run into some eastern horse archers, and must battle through several waves to survive.

Touch to select, touch to move, then touch to choose which direction to face or touch another unit to select them.  Double tap to stop on the current hex.  The green meter is health, the blue is run/charge time.  Charging in will do extra damage, as will attacking from behind.  If you run out of run/charge meter, that unit will cancel their pathing, and move to the hex they are on.  You can rearrange your units before you start.  They will attack when fired upon, but you will need to give some commands if you want to win.  It is actually pretty hard to beat.

Thank you so much for checking out my game everyone, I can't wait to check out yours!  I didn't have enough time to spend on this game.  My job is very physical and I come home really tired.  I worked on this everyday, and am proud of the finished work, as buggy as the pathfinding is.  Not enough time testing.  It is only 11.7kB.
