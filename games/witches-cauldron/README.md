# Witches Cauldron #

Keep the Black Cats distracted before they curse your towers, and catch the Critters before the Witch can put them in her pot!

Can you get 3 stars on all 7 waves?!

### Controls ###
Hold (Desktop: mouse / Mobile: touch) + Drag to place towers.

### Mobile Specific ###
While dragging, the towers are offset (left or right) from touch point to better see the tower coverage and placement. To switch the offset side while dragging, move your finger to the far right side of the screen.

**Android:**  If Chrome has loading or audio issues (hopefully fixed) Firefox should still work.

**iPhone** Everything works, it's just an *extra* tiny game without full screen. iOS tablets should be more enjoyable.
