In this dungeon crawling tower defense game you play a paranormal researcher tasked with ridding an old crypt of its supernatural inhabitants. Try to survive as long as possible while defeating wave after wave of enemies. Because you will die a lot, you can choose between hard mode (permadeath) and normal mode.

Thanks to @UlrikeErdmann, Tyber Zann, and everyone else for testing and tips and to @Siorki for the awesome regPack.
