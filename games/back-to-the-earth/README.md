50 years ago, the man has conquered the Moon. Now, you can play as an astronaut which accidentally remained on the Moon. Of course, you have to go back to Earth. You can collect objects, from old space wrecks, and if you have found enough wrecks you can build that space ship which will return you to Earth. 
You can collect memories, which the human race left on the Moon. This will represent your score.
But pay attention to your remaining oxygen. Each move cost oxygen. If you are out then you will die on the Moon!

All wreckage info and memo is based on the real Moon missions!
