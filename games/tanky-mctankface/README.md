You take control of the tank and try to go as far as you can while fighting enemy turrets. You gather items along the way, but they are not applied instantly. Only when you are destroyed and start back at the beginning, the items will be applied and you will become more powerful. Not all enemies are created equal. Compare Highscores to see how well you did. Use cursor buttons to control the tank and space to charge a shot. You can change audio settings in the menu and get there with escape. From there you can start fresh (without items) or continue the current run.
