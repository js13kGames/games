You are alone in a strange place, only with your phone, offline...
Use it and all the apps available to find a 5 bars signal, then send a message to the world... while your signal is strong enough.
Then find your way out of this place.

Ho, and pay attention to the shadows, they love light! Use your torch with parcimony, and sprint can be a good solution to avoid them!

Game as 3 phases:
- use the signal bar power to know the distance you are from the network location
- use your keyboard to repeat the message in the middle of the screen (you'll certainly need 2 or 3 levels to complete it)
- use the compass to find the way out of the level, it points in blue direction.

Have fun!
