> "You are having the same dream again... the dream where everyone must die..."

Dying Dreams is a puzzle game where you have to kill all the... uh, *"figures"* on the screen. The difficulty is that you control all of them at the same time! 

The game contains 13 puzzles, most of them not too hard (except maybe the puzzles in the end).
