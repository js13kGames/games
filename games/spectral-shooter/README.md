Undeads don't actually die. 
They go into the spectral world, and respawn after some time.

You are an undead hunter, gifted with the ability to move 
between the physical world, and the spectral world.
Dive into the spectral world to kill them for good.

Move around using WASD, ZQSD, or Arrows
Aim with mouse and shoot by holding left click.

If you ever find yourself dead, 
just collect some souls from the spectral world to revive.

If you play well, you can collect an upgrade to go to the spectral world deliberately.
