**10plus3** is a math puzzle game with a simple yet addictive mechanic: Starting from a random number, use the arrow keys to select the mathematical operations in the correct order to get 13 as the final result.

It may help fighting your triskaidekaphobia, or not. At least, you will exercise your brain.

Controls: arrow keys

Btw: don't try to finish the game, levels are randomly generated :)
