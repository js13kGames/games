Dungeon Advisor - Dungeon advice you can trust! 

Is a rogue like dungeon crawler without the crawling - or 'rogueing'. In a classical reversal of roles you are the master of the dungeon and as such you need to ensure the heroes that visit are happy. Keep the facilities fresh and inviting, the monsters difficult, the levels deep and the cuddles and kisses cheap... and hope your punters agree. 

Best played in Firefox on Windows or Chrome on OSX (other browsers are fine but font sets differ so it won't look perfect).
