(Unfinished) NES style single screen platformer.

Tested in Chrome, Firefox and IE.

Set the canvas size a little too big, so you may have to run it as full-screen (press F11)

Didn't get a chance to finish game, so game is really hard, the monsters can't shoot you and there's no penalty for letting the hearts sit in the water :(
